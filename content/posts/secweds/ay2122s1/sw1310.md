### Talk 1: 7:00pm-7:45pm
**Title: A Guide on Antivirus Evasion**

#### Description
Antivirus evasion is crucial in many cybersecurity research and operations. For example, red team exercises are often conducted in a hardened production environment. While open-source tools may help in the enumeration or exploitations of services, they are often detected and flagged by antivirus.

In this talk, we will look into manual and partially automated ways to achieve antivirus evasion. In addition, we will explore two case studies on evading detection of popular hacking tools - SharpHound and mimikatz.

#### Speaker Bio
**Glenice** graduated from NUS Information Security in 2020 and is an alumnus of NUS Greyhats. She is currently working as an associate cybersecurity specialist at Government Technology Agency. Her work focuses on web security, cloud technology, and social engineering practices.

### Talk 2: 7:45pm-8:30pm
**Title: Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap**

#### Description
What are real world bugs made of? A miserable pile of secrets. This talk is not about cool exploit techniques, nor is it about the latest bypass using complex machinery. In this talk, I present some of the cheapest no-brainer techniques that have been used to find security bugs that you as a security professional should know. We will uncover some of the dirtiest tricks people use to write software and how to break it. You won't like what you see, *but don't hate the player, hate the game*.
