### Talk: 7:00pm-8:30pm

The presentation will introduce what a Security Operations Center (SOC) is, its typical mission and responsibilities, and the different roles that make up a SOC. The speakers will talk about the various components of a SOC and how they help one another effectively detect security threats.

They will also discuss security incidents and how we respond to them. Finally, they will conclude the presentation with a show and tell how they can acquire an infected or compromised machine and what forensic artifacts they can uncover for our investigations.
