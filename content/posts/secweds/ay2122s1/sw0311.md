### Talk: 7:45pm-8:30pm
**Title: Source Engine code auditing adventure**

#### Description
In this talk I will talk about the Source Engine, the leaked codebase and how I audited it to find vulnerabilities. This also acts as a case study on how real life code basesÂ are audited.

#### Requirements
The participants should have basic knowledge on C/C++, basic knowledge on x86 memory exploitation techniques, and how exploit mitigations (NX, ASLR, Stack Canaries) work.

#### Speaker Bio
I'm Bien Pham, an offensive security engineer from the Sea Security Team. I'm known for finding vulnerabilities in Valve Corporation's games, for instance, the Counter-Strike series. I also play CTFs, mostly handling pwn challenges.
