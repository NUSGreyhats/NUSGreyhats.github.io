### Talk 1: 1900HRs - 1945HRs
**Title: Identifying Bugs in Router Firmware at Scale with Taint Analysis**

#### Description
Taint analysis is a very useful technique in reverse engineering and bug hunting. For some common vulnerability classes such as command injection or buffer overflow, it can be tedious for a researcher to find them through manual reverse engineering. In this talk, Daniel will share about a tool that he helped develop during his internship, which uses taint analysis techniques to automate the process of finding such bugs in router firmware.

#### Bio
Daniel is a Year 3 Computer Engineering student in NUS. He is currently an intern at STARLabs, to fulfil his Industrial Attachment programme requirement by the Faculty of Engineering. He is also a member of the Greyhats core team.

### Talk 2: 1945HRs - 2030HRs
**Title: The Spectre of Ransomware and the Criminal Underground**

#### Description
The Criminal Underground today is a vibrant ecosystem, with many Criminal Enterprises existing to support Big Game Hunting (BGH) Ransomware Operations.

Notable to the past year is the emergence of Access Brokers supporting a variety of Criminal Adversaries, including the most prolific Ransomware Operators, with initial access into their target environments.Also, a number of dramatic shifts have been observed in the BGH space, including the exponential surge in the adoption of the Extortion and Data Leaks tactics and the rise of Ransomware-as-a-Service.

This talk strives to take a deep dive into these recent threat trends and offer the audience with useful insights to better defend your organisation against the spectre of Ransomware and eCrime.
