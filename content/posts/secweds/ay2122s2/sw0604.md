### Talk 2: 1945Hrs - 2030Hrs

**Title: A case study of an incorrect bitwise and optimization in V8**

#### Description

This presentation is an introduction to developing a proof-of-concept for a Chrome V8 Turbofan vulnerability. In this session, we will take a look at an example, starting with what the bug is, and how the author of an incorrect optimization bug might have developed the POC leading to an out-of-bounds access. Details of exploitation will not be covered but an overview will be given.

#### Speaker Bio
**Lucas** is a security researcher in STAR Labs, whose work is mainly focused on n-day analyses.
