### Talk 1: 1900Hrs - 1945Hrs
**Talk Title: How to build an automated Incident Response and Forensics Readiness Framework on AWS**

This talk aims to provide insights into how you can build and automate incident response and forensics on AWS. This talk aims to show some of the problems our customers were facing and how we helped solve them. This use-case was developed for a customer operating a large set of accounts. 

Their problems were:
* Incident Response and Forensics was a manual process prone to mistakes
* Time-consuming process with many steps
* Hard to perform by non-trained personnel


To address this we created the Automated Incident Response and Forensics framework. The framework aims to facilitate automated steps for incident response and forensics based on the AWS Incident Response [White Paper.](https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/aws_security_incident_response.pdf) The goal is to provide a set of processes.
