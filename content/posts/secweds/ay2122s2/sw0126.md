### Talk: 7:00pm-7:45pm
**Title: An introduction to container hacking**

#### Description
Now that containers, Docker and Kubernetes are everywhere, we have to ask the most important question 'how do we hack them!' . This talk will take a look at some of the underpinnings of how these systems work, to give you ideas on where to start and then look at some classic container hacking techniques.
