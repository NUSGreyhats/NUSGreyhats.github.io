**Talk Title: ARM Confidential Compute Architecture (ARM CCA)**

#### Description

ARM CCA represents the latest effort of ARM in pursuing general confidential computing. While ARM has provided a Formal Security Verification (FSV) simulation platform to help develop and test applications on ARMv9 platform, there lacks a Quick Emulator (QEMU) based simulation platform for better debugging. Upon this request, we developed a QEMU-based CCA simulation platform to more easily identify design faults in Realm applications. The source code is made available for public access.
