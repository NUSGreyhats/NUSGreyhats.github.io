**Title: Intro to Heap Pwn (Part 2)**

#### Description
This is a continuation of the Heap Pwn 1 workshop. We will be going through how to setup a Dockerized environment for heap pwn so that we can target different `libc`s. We will also
cover some tricks we can use to defeat mitigations and how our foundational knowledge can
be used to solve more complicated heap problems. There will be more hands-on sessions :)
