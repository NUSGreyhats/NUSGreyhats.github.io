**Title: Intro to Heap Pwn (Part 1)**

#### Description
How often do you use new in C++, and malloc in C? The heap is used for dynamically allocated memory supporting those operations, and we will be breaking the heap in this workshop. We will cover the basic mechanics of how the glibc malloc/free works, and various underlying structures that are used to track memory.

We will also cover some basic attacks against vulnerable applications, aided by pwndbg.
