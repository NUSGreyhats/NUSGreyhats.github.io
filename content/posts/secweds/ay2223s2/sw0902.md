**Title:  Introduction to Computer Networking & Wireshark workshop.**

#### Description

Ever wondered how information travels from your computer to the internet and back? 

Join us in this beginner-level session, where we will share the basics of computer networking! Using a program called Wireshark, you will be able to see firsthand what happens when you send some data to the internet. Additionally, we will also be doing some fun networking forensics-related activities!

Year 1s and those without networking knowledge are welcome!

 
#### Setup

1. Do bring a fully-charged laptop as power points are very limited
2. Install Wireshark (https://www.wireshark.org/#download) before coming!
3. Join our discord server (https://discord.gg/yj5fuevA) as workshop materials will be disseminated there
