This is where our website lives.

We use Hugo so that we don't need to mess with any HTML when we add more content.

### Team

To add your profile to the team page, head over to [team.yml](/data/team.yml) and add your entry as follows:

```yml
- name: <your name>
  major: <your enrolled major>
  roles:
    - <role 1>
    - <role 2>
  desc: <description of yourself>
  twitter: <twitter profile url> # delete this line if you don't have
  linkedin: <linkedin profile url> # delete this line if you don't have
  github: <github profile url> # delete this line if you don't have
  personal: <personal homepage url> # delete this line if you don't have
```

Once you're done, make a PR and wait for it to go live!
