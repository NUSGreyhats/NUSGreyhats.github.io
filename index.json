We will also walk-through some basic ctf challenges from picoGym.\nWriteup table of content  Tools and programming requirements What is APK? Developer vs reverse engineer CTF walk-through Conclusion References  Tools and programming requirements Recommended tools to follow through this writeup:\n Android Studio decompiler.com Android Debug Bridge vscode \u0026amp; vscode plugin \u0026ndash; APKLab dex2jar jd-gui-windows  Some understanding basic understanding of Java.\nWhat is APK? APK is the the Android application package file formatted used by the Android operating system, mainly used for distribution and installation of apps on android devices. It is an archive (.zip) and we could open it in a file archiver tools such as winRAR and observe the package contents of the apk.\n Screenshot of an apk\u0026rsquo;s package content when opened in winRAR\n Package content The apk has a typical file structure of the following format:\n META-INF/  MANIFEST.MF (the Manifest file) CERT.SF (list of resources and a SHA-1 digest)   classes.dex (Dalvik bytecode) lib/  x86_64 (compiled code for x86-64 processors only) x86 (compiled code for x86 processors only) arm64-v8a (compiled code for all ARMv8 arm64 and above based processors only) armeabi-v7a (compiled code for all ARMv7 and above based processors only)   assets/ -resources.arsc res/values/strings.xml AndroidManifest.xml  Those files name in bold are the files that we are usually interested in as they contain the byte source code, the native functions (external functions) and data used by the app.\nDeveloper vs reverse engineer We first look from the perspective of an android developer:\nMost of the android applications are written in Java and kotlin. The Java source code written is compiled by Standard Java Compiler into Dalvik Executable (DEX) bytecode format. The bytecode finally gets executed by either one of the two different virtual machines Dalvik and Android Runtime(ART). For earlier versions of Android, the bytecode was translated by the Dalvik virtual machine. For more recent versions of Android (4.4++), Android Runtime (ART) was introduced and in subsequent versions, it replaced Dalvik.\n Flowchat of the common steps an Android developer takes\n And from the perspective a reverse engineer:\nA reverse engineer will do the opposite to restore back the source code. There are generally 2 approaches that one could take. The normal method and the shortcut method.\nThe normal method will reverse the DEX bytecode into SMALI instructions using dex2jar, you can think of it like the assembly language which is between the high level code and the bytecode. With the Smali code, we could either continue to reverse using jd-gui and obtain the decompiled java source code but we could also modify the smali code and patch the apk to access hidden information.\nThe shortcut method is a direct method that will decompile the apk into its source code using decompiler.com. This method allows us to quickly obtain the apk source code and its package contents. This is the method that we will mainly rely on for the CTF challenge walk-through.\n 2 approaches the reverse engineer could take to reverse apks\n CTF walkthrough Let\u0026rsquo;s take a look at 2 apk reversing challenges from picoGym, we will apply the shortcut method and any additional steps to capture the flags. For the challenges, I will be running the apks in an android emulator Pixel_3a_API_30_x86 via Android Studio. For more information, check out android studio setup and install android emulator. Alternatively, if you have an android device, you could also connect to your computer via USB cable and launch it with android studio following this guide.\ndroids0 AUTHOR: JASON DESCRIPTION: Where do droid logs go. Running the apk We can start off by opening the apk via Android Studio (File \u0026gt; PROFILE or DEBUG apk) and then running it on our emulator (Shift + F10). The android emulator will launch and the apk will run and display the following main screen.\nWe can interact with the UI of the app, such as pressing the buttons and check for any hidden drawers. Upon pressing the button, the text below the button changes from \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m a flag!\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;Not Today\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nIt seems like we triggered an event but we don\u0026rsquo;t get any flag output. Let\u0026rsquo;s decompile the apk.\nDecompile the apk and understanding the code Using the shortcut method via decompiler.com, we can obtain the source code of the apk:\none of the files that stands out is sources/com/helloccmu/picoctf/FlagstaffHill.java and with the following code:\npackage com.hellocmu.picoctf;  import android.content.Context; import android.util.Log;  public class FlagstaffHill {  public static native String paprika(String str);   public static String getFlag(String input, Context ctx) {  Log.i(\u0026#34;PICO\u0026#34;, paprika(input));  return \u0026#34;Not Today...\u0026#34;;  } } The getFlag() function when invoked will log the output of paprika(input) and return \u0026quot;Not Today...\u0026quot; which corresponds to what we observed earlier on, it seems like the flag has been passed into the Log.i() function invocation.\nWhere does the output of Log.i go? Log represents the Logger class for Android development, and serves as API for sending log output. There are different levels of problems and information that the developer could tag the log messages. The output can be captured via Android Studio or via CLI logcat.\nGet flag So, to get the flag, we could inspect the log outputs in our Android Studio instance. We can apply the info filter to filter out the irrelevant stuff.\ndroids1 AUTHOR: JASON DESCRIPTION: Find the pass, get the flag. Running the apk Following the steps from the previous walk-though, we will setup and interact with the UI of the app.\nIt seems like the application is asking us for a password, if the wrong password is provided, it will output to us \u0026ldquo;NOPE\u0026rdquo;\nDecompile the apk and understanding the code Using the shortcut method via decompiler.com, we can obtain the source code of the apk:\none of the files that stands out is sources/com/helloccmu/picoctf/FlagstaffHill.java and with the following code:\npackage com.hellocmu.picoctf;  import android.content.Context;  public class FlagstaffHill {  public static native String fenugreek(String str);   public static String getFlag(String input, Context ctx) {  if (input.equals(ctx.getString(R.string.password))) {  return fenugreek(input);  }  return \u0026#34;NOPE\u0026#34;;  } } The getFlag() function when invoked will check our input with a password string. If the strings are not equal, the function will output \u0026ldquo;NOPE\u0026rdquo;.\nOur aim is to locate the password at ctx.getString(R.string.password)) and after some searching within the decompiled apk, there is a suspicious file /resources/res/values/strings.xml and it contains a password field with the following data:\nGet flag Try out the password that we restored and obtained the flag!\nConclusion There are definitely more areas to cover in Android reversing such as apk patching, dynamic debugging \u0026amp; native function hooking and I hoped that you\u0026rsquo;ve enjoyed reading and learnt something new. If you want to learn more, I recommend trying out different kinds of challenges from picoGym, past ctf challenges and reading up cyber security articles and papers.\nReferences  https://developer.android.com/guide/components/fundamentals.html http://www.theappguruz.com/blog/android-compilation-process https://www.ragingrock.com/AndroidAppRE https://book.hacktricks.xyz/mobile-apps-pentesting/android-app-pentesting https://programmer.help/blogs/smali-introduction-manual.html https://medium.com/shipbook/android-log-levels-c0313055fdb9 https://frida.re/  ","permalink":"https://nusgreyhats.org/posts/writeups/introduction-to-android-app-reversing/","summary":"Overview This writeup will cover some of the basic techniques and methodologies that one could use to reverse and solve android apk challenges.

Burp is all-in-one platform for website security testing. It has a variety of tools, such as:\n Proxy to intercept, inspect, and modify HTTP requests A repeater to easily edit and re-send HTTP requests An \u0026ldquo;intruder\u0026rdquo; to send multiple requests (one use case is to brute-force a login page) Text encoder/decoder (HTML, URL, Base64, etc.)  Why Burp Suite? When we are doing security testing, we want to give the application (lots of) unusual inputs. When we are dealing with website, these inputs are in the form of HTTP requests, be it GET, POST, or other type of requests. Burp allows us to easily modify and send these HTTP requests.\nBurp also has a lot of advanced features (e.g. automatically scan the website for vulnerabilities), but that is a different topic and will not be covered in this writeup.\nSetting Up You can download burp from here.\nBurp has its own built-in chromium browser, but you can also configure it to work with external browsers like Chrome and Firefox. You may need to configure your browser proxy setting to use burp, and you can find out how by going to this link. Additionally, you may want to install FoxyProxy so you can easily change your browser\u0026rsquo;s proxy setting.\n*In this writeup, we will try to attack online labs by PortSwigger. You may want to create an account first before continuing.\nUsing Burp Suite In this writeup, we will cover the following:\n Proxy Repeater Intruder (and Turbo Intruder)  To do that, we will try to perform OS Comand Injection attack and login bruteforce attack.\nProxy  Burp Proxy is a web proxy server between your browser and target applications, and lets you intercept, inspect, and modify the raw traffic passing in both directions.\n If you don\u0026rsquo;t know what a proxy server is, Wikipedia gives a pretty good explanation. Instead of sending HTTP request directly to the target, your browser will send the request to the proxy server and the proxy server will forward (or edit/drop) the request to the target.\nFirst, open burp and go to the Proxy tab. You will see something like this: You can click Open Browser to use Burp\u0026rsquo;s built-in browser, or open your own browser if you have configured the proxy settings. Make sure the intercept option is on.\nNow, try to go to any website. Your browser should hang and you can see this in your Burp: Here, the browser sent a GET request to Burp, but we have not forwarded the request. That\u0026rsquo;s why we don\u0026rsquo;t see anything loaded in our browser. At this stage, we can try to tinker around and change the request header to OPTIONS or POST, or we can change the cookie and add new data inside the request body. After we are done editing the request, we can press Forward and the request will be sent to the target.\nNote:\n If you are trying to access sites like Yahoo or Youtube, you can get hundreds of HTTP requests, and manually clicking Forward can be tiring. You can turn off the intercept option and all requests will be forwarded automatically. You can always review the requests you have sent from the HTTP History tab.\n Repeater  Burp Repeater is a simple tool for manually manipulating and reissuing individual HTTP and WebSocket messages, and analyzing the application\u0026rsquo;s responses. You can use Repeater for all kinds of purposes, such as changing parameter values to test for input-based vulnerabilities, issuing requests in a specific sequence to test for logic flaws, and reissuing requests from Burp Scanner issues to manually verify reported issues.\n To begin, turn off the intercept option from the previos section and go to https://portswigger.net/web-security/os-command-injection/lab-simple to access the lab. Note that even when our intercept is turned off, burp will still record all HTTP requests it forwarded.\nAccording to the lab description, the application contains an OS command injection vulnerability in the product stock checker. Let\u0026rsquo;s try to see a product and check its stock: After we clicked the button, we can see the stock of the product, but nothing more. Now, turn on the intercept option and try to check the stock again. We can see that our browser is actually sending a POST request to the app. We can play with the store ID. We can put whoami, 123456, etc. But, this process of going to the page, intercepting the request, changing the request, and then forwarding the request is very cumbersome. Let\u0026rsquo;s find another way.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s see the HTTP history: Now, right click on the request, then select Send to repeater.\nHere, we can send the POST request to the server again and again by changing the request and clicking Send. There\u0026rsquo;s no need for us to go to the page, intercept the request, change the request, and forward the request again and again.\nTo solve the lab, close the current command with a semicolon and inject whoami. The username will be printed on the Response tab. Intruder  Burp Intruder is a tool for automating customized attacks against web applications. It is extremely powerful and configurable, and can be used to perform a huge range of tasks, from simple brute-force guessing of web directories through to active exploitation of complex blind SQL injection vulnerabilities.\n To demonstrate this feature, we will try to solve https://portswigger.net/web-security/authentication/password-based/lab-username-enumeration-via-different-responses.\nWe are given a list of possible usernames and passwords, and our job is to login to the platform.\nOf course, we can try to manually try every single combination from the web page, or use the repeater to directly edit the HTTP request. But, it will take a lot of time if we have to do this manually. What we can do, is to right click on the login request and send it to intruder. There are four different modes of intruder: sniper, Battering ram, Pitchfork, and Cluster bomb. We will use sniper mode for this example and will not cover the difference between those attack types, but you can read more here if you want to know more.\nFirst, go to Positions tab and clear all markers. Then, add a marker on the username field. Next, go to the Payload tab and paste the wordlist from the lab website. Finally, click Start attack to initiate the attack. This will take a while if you are using the free (community) version.\nAfter the attack is finished, sort the response according to its length, and we can see that one response has different length. Indeed, this is the correct username we are looking for. Now, we put the correct username, add a marker for the password tab, and repeat the process again to get the password.\nTurbo Intruder If you are using Burp community edition, you will realize that the intruder is really slow. Its rate is limited to around one request per second. So, if you have thousands of requests to be sent, it can take forever. Luckily, we have an alternative called Turbo Intruder. To use it, we must first install it from the BApp store under the Extender tab. Then, from our HTTP history tab, instead of sending the packet to intruder, we select Extensions and Send to Turbo Intruder Turbo intruder uses python, so you can really customize your own code if you understand Python\u0026rsquo;s syntax. We save the wordlist from the lab website locally, and then we put a format string specifier %s to indicate the string we want to change. You can change the number of threads used to send the requests, as well as the number of requests for each connection. A word of caution, if you set these numbers wrongly, you can overload and crash the server and/or crash your own computer (most probably your computer will crash before the server does though). Also, in some cases, you want to keep these numbers low because the server may reject the connection if it has a rate limiting algorithm in place.\nSetting the number of threads to be 5 and the number of connections to be 1, we can achieve around 9 requests per second, which is 9 times better than the original burp intruder. Moving forward Now that you know the basic, the next thing to do is to practice :)\nYou can start by solving the challenges in these websites:\n DVWA WebGoat PortSwigger Academy  Then, if you are interested with pentesting real sites, you can read Web Hacking 101 by Peter Yaworski and go to Hackerone and try to find some real vulnerabilities.

A brief illustration is shown below.\nThe original idea originates from an internship that I have done, and this personal project is an attempt on my own to improve and expand on what I done previously. The project is still a work in progress.\nPython and its associated libraries (mainly Pandas, Sklearn and some SpaCy) are used.\nRaw Data Gathering and Filtering Data for this project is taken from CVE JSON data feeds provided by the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). Each data feed contains details of CVEs in a particular year, with the earliest data feed coming from the year 2002. The JSON data feeds contain tons of data about each CVE, such as the CWEs associated with it, references, descriptions, CVSS V2 and V3 metrics, and published dates.\nAs the JSON data feeds are quite complex, they cannot be easily parsed into a dataframe using Pandas and Python\u0026rsquo;s json library due to their extremely nested structure and missing fields when data is absent. Thus, I decided to just extract the essential data (CVE description, base CVSS V2 score, and base CVSS V3 score) that will be needed from the data feeds instead of trying to parse all data into a nice dataframe. Since not every CVE has an associated CVSS V2 or V3 score, missing scores are temporarily replaced with a None when extracting these data. The function used is shown here:\ndef get_useful_features(raw_cve_entry):  entry = dict()  try:  entry[\u0026#34;description\u0026#34;] = raw_cve_entry[\u0026#34;cve\u0026#34;][\u0026#34;description\u0026#34;][\u0026#34;description_data\u0026#34;][0][\u0026#34;value\u0026#34;]  except KeyError:  entry[\u0026#34;description\u0026#34;] = None  try:  entry[\u0026#34;baseScoreV3\u0026#34;] = raw_cve_entry[\u0026#34;impact\u0026#34;][\u0026#34;baseMetricV3\u0026#34;][\u0026#34;cvssV3\u0026#34;][\u0026#34;baseScore\u0026#34;]  except KeyError:  entry[\u0026#34;baseScoreV3\u0026#34;] = None  try:  entry[\u0026#34;baseScoreV2\u0026#34;] = raw_cve_entry[\u0026#34;impact\u0026#34;][\u0026#34;baseMetricV2\u0026#34;][\u0026#34;cvssV2\u0026#34;][\u0026#34;baseScore\u0026#34;]  except KeyError:  entry[\u0026#34;baseScoreV2\u0026#34;] = None  return entry The extracted essential data can be seen below.\nAfter extracting the data, a quick look at the data will show that there are many unusable CVEs that are included in the data (See row 177474 in the figure above). The different reasons for the CVEs to be not usable is shown below, along with the number of CVEs that is tagged with that reason.\n   Reason for not being used Number of CVEs     REJECT 10349   DISPUTED 897   UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED 91   PRODUCT NOT SUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED 6   UNVERIFIABLE 5   UNVERIFIABLE, PRERELEASE 2   SPLIT 1    Since they all had a description that starts with ** \u0026lt;REASON\u0026gt; **, a quick regex matching was done to filter out and remove these unneeded data.\ndf = df[~(df.description.str.contains(\u0026#39;^\\\\*\\\\*\\\\s+[A-Z]+\\\\s+\\\\*\\\\*\\\\s+\u0026#39;))] # Remove unneeded CVEs Initially, I thought of using both base CVSS V2 and V3 scores in the project, simply to see which score can be better predicted. However, after looking at the counts of each metric, I realised that the number of CVEs with base CVSS V2 scores (165904) vastly outnumbered the number of CVEs with base CVSS V3 scores (92983). As such, I then decided to remove all CVEs that do not have a base CVSS V2 score and just focus on predicting base CVSS V2 scores, simply as that would allow me more data to work with.\ndf.dropna(inplace=True, subset=[\u0026#34;baseScoreV2\u0026#34;]) After the removal of unusable CVEs and CVEs that do not have an associated base CVSS V2 score, I was left with a total of 165904 rows of CVE entries, shown below.\nThe CVE entries are then split into train and test data.\nX = df[\u0026#34;description\u0026#34;] y = df[\u0026#34;baseScoreV2\u0026#34;]  X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3) The distribution of base CVSS V2 scores of the training data is shown below.\nML Pipeline Construction Since I have filtered out all unneedded data, I can proceed to create the ML pipelines. The pipelines will consists of 3 steps:\n Vectorizer to convert CVE descriptions into a vector form suitable to be fed into ML algorithms. An optional PCA algorithm to reduce the dimensions of the input from the vectorizer. The actual ML model that will be used.  NLP Processing and Vectorizing Firstly, I chose the easy way out and used the Bag-of-Words (BoW) and TF-IDF models to vectorize the descriptions. These 2 models can be invoked by simply using Sklearn\u0026rsquo;s CountVectorizer and TfidfVectorizer. To augment these vectorizers, I used SpaCy to write a custom tokenizer function to do basic NLP processing on these descriptions which can be fed into Sklearn\u0026rsquo;s vectorizers. The Python library SpaCy is used for this purpose since it contains pretrained NLP pipelines which simplifies this processing step immensely.\n# Create custom tokenizer def tokenizer(desc):  tokens = nlp(desc)  tokens = [word.lemma_.lower().strip() for word in tokens]  tokens = [word for word in tokens if word not in nlp.Defaults.stop_words and not set(word).issubset(punctuation)]  return tokens The function first feeds each description into SpaCy\u0026rsquo;s en_core_web_lg pretrained pipeline, where they are tokenized. Then, each token is stripped off leading and trailing whitespaces, before being converted to lowercase and lemmatized. If the token is a punctuation or a stop word, it is removed too. The result is then a list of tokens that will be used by Sklearn\u0026rsquo;s vectorizers to fit the BoW and TF-IDF models. The output of the vectorizers will then be a word vector that represents the CVE description that was fed in.\nThe vectorizers and parameters used are shown below:\nCountVectorizer(tokenizer=tokenizer,  ngram_range=(1,2),  max_df=0.5,  min_df=5,  max_features=10000,)  TfidfVectorizer(tokenizer=tokenizer,  ngram_range=(1,2),  max_df=0.5,  min_df=5,  max_features=10000,) PCA for Dimensionality Reduction As the dimensions of the word vectors are very large due to the large vocabulary accumulated from all the training CVE descriptions, PCA is used reduce the number of dimensions of the word vectors. However, as including this step increases the computational time by a lot, this step is ommitted in most of the pipelines that I created.\nTruncatedSVD(n_components=10000, n_iter=7, random_state=42) Choosing ML Models Since my aim is just to explore which ML model will give a better result, I chose a few simple models to get a basic feel of how well a model can predict the base CVSS V2 scores using their associated CVE descriptions (The models were also chosen with considerations for my potato laptop).\nModels chosen were:\n Linear Regression KNN Decision Trees Gradient Boosting Regression (Xgboost)  With the exception of Linear Regression which was fitted on transformed features from both BoW and TF-IDF vectorizers, the other 3 models were only fitted on transformed data from the TF-IDF vectorizer.\nlinear_regr = LinearRegression()  knn_regr = KNeighborsRegressor()  dt_regr = DecisionTreeRegressor(min_samples_split=5, min_samples_leaf=3,)  xgboost_regr = GradientBoostingRegressor() Results To score results of the models, Mean Square Error was chosen as the evaluation metric, since I want to penalize models more for larger errors. As the target base CVSS V2 score only ranges from 0 to 10, the predicted values of the models are further fed into a function that constrains the predicted values to this range (predicted values that are less than 0 to 0, and all predicted values more than 10 to 10).\ny_pred = np.clip(pipeline.predict(X_test), 0, 10) mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred) Results are shown in the table below. Do note fine tuning of models have not been done as of the writing of this writeup since it is probably going to take a long time to run and burn up my laptop.\n   Model Vectorizer Have PCA MSE     Linear Regression BoW False 1.62   Linear Regression TF-IDF False 1.66   Linear Regression BoW True 1.59   KNN TF-IDF False 1.92   Decision Trees TF-IDF False 2.22   Xgboost TF-IDF False 1.91    Discussion and Future Work As can be seen, the BoW vectorizer seem to produce slightly better results than the TF-IDF vectorizer. Inclusion of the PCA algorithm also provides some slight improvements. Comparing the different models used, linear regression seem to have produced the best results.\nOverall, the best MSE of 1.59 is a good sign, especially since the pipelines are not optimised at all. This shows that the ML model will on average have an error of about 1.59 when prediciting CVSS scores, which is still acceptable since 1.59 is not too much over the range of 0 to 10.\nIn the future, work will be done in the following aspects:\n Constructing a recurrent neural network to compare against the performance of these classic ML algorithms. Perform more pre-processing on the CVSS scores, since they are not very normally distributed. Incorporate word vectors and compare performance against the BoW and TF-IDF vectorizers. Optimising hyperparameters to get an optimal model. Employing the model for various use cases.

This writeup explains how forensics is applied in the real world, and common techniques/challenges used in CTFs.\nIf you are already well versed with digital forensics and would like to learn about digital forensics in CTFs, you may skip to here.\nThe term \u0026ldquo;forensics\u0026rdquo; originally means \u0026ldquo;of or before the forum\u0026rdquo;. The modern meaning of \u0026ldquo;forensics\u0026rdquo; is a form of legal evidence to be presented.\nDigital Forensics There are multiple aspects of digital forensics. They include but are not limited to:\n File System Forensics Memory Forensics Network Forensics Database Forensics Application Forensics E-mail Forensics  In this writeup, we will be focusing on file system forensics, memory forensics, and network forensics.\nFile System Forensics Files or folders can be hidden by:\n having their names start with . (in Linux) marking them as hidden (in Windows) deleting them  Deleted files can potentially be recovered through data carving using specific tools. Data carving is the process of reassembling computer files from fragments in the absence of filesystem metadata.\nWhen a file is deleted, the entry in the file system metadata is removed. However, the actual data still remains on the disk. The data is only lost after is is overwritten by new data. This is why in digital forensics, it is important to not write new data into the medium that you are carrying out forensics on.\nLet me explain this in simpler terms.\nImagine you have a folder containing many sheets of papers. The first page of the folder is a contents page. In real life, when you want to remove a piece of paper from the file permanently, you will simply do so. However, that is not the case for computers. In computers, what happens is that the entry in the contents page gets erased, while the piece of paper inside the file remains untouched. When you need to write new information into the folder, the pages with the unwanted content gets overwritten with new information, while what remains of the old, unwanted information gets ignored.\nMemory Forensics Hard disks contain a myriad of data. They not only contain data of your files and folders, but also store much more information that most people aren\u0026rsquo;t aware about. These essential groups of data contain metadata and other bits of information that makes a hard drive behave correctly. Chunks of space in hard drives are reserved for metadata.\nHowever, not all of the space in those chunks are actually utilized. This allows for data to be written and hidden in these empty spaces, and will not affect the typical functionality of the hard drive in any way. Examples of parts of the hard drive where data can be hidden in are:\n Host Protected Area \u0026amp; Device Configuration Overlay Unused space in the Master Boot Record Volume Slack Partition Slack Boot sector in Non-bootable partition Unallocated space in a partition Good blocks marked \u0026ldquo;bad\u0026rdquo; Disk Slack Unused space in superblock Unused space in block groups Directory entries  Data hidden in these areas of a hard disk can be found through the process of data carving.\nNetwork Forensics Network traffic is extremely volatile. This is why network forensics should be a proactive investigation.\nHow to capture network traffic? To capture network traffic, run a network monitoring tool such as Wireshark.\nWhere to capture network traffic? Network traffic should be captured at an endpoint, such as a proxy server, or at a forensic PC connected to the mirror port of an internet router.\nAt these locations, investigators can collect unicast traffic sent from the host in question.\nComputer networks have layers In computer networking, there are several layers. Namely, the application, transport, network, and data-link layers. Each layer employs different protocols to ensure that data moves from one place to another correctly. This also means that there are different types of evidence we can collect from each layer.\nApplication Layer  DNS, SMTP, HTTPS and HTTP protocols are used in this layer.  DNS translates a domain name into the correct IP address. SMTP is used to send and receive mail. HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP, and is used to fetch HTML files to load web pages.    HTTP is not secure because the data is sent in plain text. This means that if a malicious actor gained unlawful access into a network (or if they are in the vicinity of the victim), and if a user enters their login details to gain access to their own account on a certain website, the malicious actor will be able to acquire them by sniffing the packets on the network sent by the unsuspecting user. HTTPS fixes that problem by encrypting data being received and sent by a host, and is still in use to this day since its introduction in 1994.\nTransport Layer The transport layer optionally ensures the reliability of communications. TCP and UDP are used here.\n TCP is used in connections where reliability is of paramount importance. For example, in sending texts, streaming videos, or sending files. UDP is used in connections where speed takes precedence over reliability. For example, in voice/video calls, or when playing online games.  Network Layer The network layer is in charge of routing packets across networks.\nThe IP protocol delivers packets from the source host to destination host based on the IP addresses present in packet headers.\nData-link layer The data-link layer is responsible for handling communications on the physical network components.\nWith the right expertise and tools, it is possible to eavesdrop on wired communications that go through ethernet cables.\nNetwork Forensics as a whole At the beginning of network forensics, investigators begin with very limited information such as an IP address, port number, and a protocol.\nHowever, this is enough to search for more sources of data for more useful information. Most of the time, the more useful evidence is found in the application layer.\nDespite this, investigators might still need additional IP addresses to identify other hosts involved in the malicious activity. Certain activities such as DDoS attacks do not have relevant application-level data.\nTherefore, network forensics provides important support to the overall analysis of activities happening in the application layer.\nForensics in CTFs In CTFs, forensics is a very popular category. It is also important to note that while some challenges may be marked as \u0026ldquo;forensics\u0026rdquo;, they may also employ steganography and/or cryptography to make them even more challenging.\nSteganography involves hiding data, while cryptography makes it difficult to understand the data. More often than not, you might find yourself going deep into rabbit holes that lead to absolutely nowhere. It may be frustrating, but it\u0026rsquo;ll feel very rewarding once you get the flag.\nHere are some tips you can use to get started with common/easy forensics challenges.\nImage Forensics Hidden in plain sight  Sometimes, information can be hidden in plain sight, just like in this example\n On the left is an image downloaded from a challenge. On the right is the same image but filled with white, which reveals a hidden URL in a slightly different tone of red.\nMetadata Instead of data being hidden inside the image, they might be hidden in the metadata. By viewing the properties of the file or by using an online tool such as Jeffrey\u0026rsquo;s Image Metadata Viewer, we will be able to see these information.\nHidden strings  Potential flag hidden in the image file, when viewed using HxD, a hex editing software\n When viewed in a text or hex editor, images may contain strings like these. These strings, when placed in certain parts of the file, will not affect the image in any way. This means that the image can still be opened and viewed normally using an image viewer.\nIn Linux systems, there is a command called strings. You can also run this command with the given file to see if there are any readable secrets.\nHidden Files  Hidden files found and extracted from a file using binwalk\n Similar to hiding a string, files can also be hidden in images. They are typically concatenated after the bytes of the image. They can be found and extracted using tools such as binwalk.\nLeast Significant Bit (LSB) As you know, files are made up of bytes. 1 byte is equal to 8 bits. If the least significant bit of a byte is changed, it will not change the overall value by too much.\nUsing this idea, we can potentially hide messages in binary in images by altering the LSB of all the pixel values. This will not make any significant change to the image, and will practically go unnoticed by humans.\nTo extract the hidden information, simply go through all the bytes, take the LSB, and append it to the string of extracted LSBs. Then, convert the final binary string into a readable message or even a file.\nTo learn more about LSB Steganography, this tutorial provides a more in-depth explanation of how it works.\nAudio Forensics Binary or Morse Code A peak in a soundwave may denote a 1, while a trough may denote a 0. This is a simple way to hide messages encoded in binary or Morse code in an audio file.\n Screenshot of a Forensics challenge, where the high represents 1, and the low represents 0.\n For challenges like this, a visual aid might be useful. I recommend opening the file in Audacity first before conducting further analysis.\nSpectrogram Even though it is an audio file that you\u0026rsquo;re dealing with, the challenge author might want to hide visual information in the sound. Not in the form of waves, but through spectrograms.\n QR Code hidden in spectrogram\n One way to view spectrograms in audio files is through this online tool called Spectrum Analyzer.\nNetwork Forensics Hidden in plain sight  HTTP sends unencrypted packets from one endpoint to another, making it incredibly unsecure\n Given a packet capture (pcap) file, you can find out what has been done, and what has been communicated over two hosts.\nFirstly, open the pcap file in Wireshark. For simpler challenges, the flags can be present in plain text— you\u0026rsquo;ll just need to know what to look for.\nUnsecured protocols such as HTTP should first be used as filters to get the low-lying fruit.\nFollow the TCP Stream On a given pcap file, there might be a need to extract messages or files that have been sent from one host to another. This can be done by following a TCP stream, then saving the contents of the stream.\nIf there are multiple types of files in the packet capture, you may want to check out this guide on how to export objects from different types of traffic in Wireshark.\nUnknown file Forensics Identify file signature What happens when you are given a file with an unknown extension, or even one that doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist?\nLuckily, files always have two attributes we can use to identify them. The first way is through the extension (png, jpg, mp4, wav, pdf, etc.). The second way is through file signatures.\nA file signature is a unique group of bytes located at the beginning of a file. File signatures are used to identify or verify the content of a file.\nHere is a list of file signatures you can use to figure out what type of file you are dealing with.\nAlternatively, you may also run file or binwalk on the unknown file to identify it automatically.\nBroken file signatures Uh oh, you realised that the extension of the given file is unknown, and the signature does not exist in the given list. Now what?\nAt this point, you may check if there are any similarities between the broken signature you were given, and legitimate signatures. Chances are, you might just need to fix a few bytes here and there before the file becomes readable.\nConversely, the file signature might be legitimate, but the file extension isn\u0026rsquo;t. In such cases, simply change the extension to the one that corresponds to the file signature, and you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to open the file.\nOS Forensics Event Logs  A security log entry depicting a logon event in Event Viewer\n Login time, number of failed password attempts, last logon attempt, and other security \u0026amp; system related logs can be found in the Event Viewer of Windows machines. They may provide useful information on what last went down in a computer system.\nBrowser Artifacts Browser history, passwords, cookies, temporary internet files, and bookmarks might prove to be useful in an investigation. Be sure to check these if you are given a snapshot of an operating system and need to look for clues.\nUser Directories Operating systems may contain different profiles. If what you are looking for is not present in the current user\u0026rsquo;s directory, chances are that you might be looking in the wrong place.\nTry going to other users\u0026rsquo; home directories to see if there are any files of interest.\nHidden Directories/Files  A directory in windows with the \u0026ldquo;Hidden\u0026rdquo; attribute\n Still can\u0026rsquo;t find what you are looking for? That might be a sign that some data cannot be seen through normal means.\nIn Windows\u0026rsquo; File Explorer, check that View -\u0026gt; Hidden Items is enabled. This allows you to see hidden files and folders.\nIn Linux machines, files and folders may be renamed to begin with ., which will be ignored by the ls command. To show these hidden items, use ls -a instead.\nConclusion There are many more aspects of digital forensics that were not covered in this writeup, as it was meant to be a brief introduction for beginners. I personally recommend trying the challenges over at ctflearn.com for beginner-level ones.

This post will document a writeup on the challenge Reversing 101 as I thought it is quite a fun to reverse a tic tac toe game and find flag.\n  PS: The CTF came in a mixed reality/game world concept where instead of the usual web portal where we submit our flags, it is done in a Unity game mirroring the HTX Office in real life. We get to see our teammates in game too in various avatars and have to uncover/hunt for \u0026lsquo;quests\u0026rsquo; in game to unlock the CTF challenges. Other than the lack of features in-game like the ability to chat, this CTF was quite a novel one replacing the face to face physical competitions in this COVID-19 pandemic.\nUnderstanding the binary Since the challenge title already hints that this is a reversing challenge, we can first analyse the binary to know what we are dealing with.\nUploading the file onto VirusTotal is a easy way to figure it, so upon upload we get the following:\n  Access the full VirusTotal Report here\nIndicating that this binary is a PE32 executable for MS Windows (GUI) Intel 80386 32-bit Mono/.Net assembly.\n  We can verify this using local tools as well, for example on Detect It Easy, identifying it to be a .NET(v4.0.30319) binary. This would mean that we can test this binary out on a Windows VM. Interestingly, Confuser(1.X) was also identified, this will be useful later.\nTesting the binary Before going into reversing the program, let\u0026rsquo;s first understand what it does.\n  Launching the program, we expectedly get a GUI program showing a Tic Tac Toe game. The symbols and font of the game looks suspicious, and in the background a familiar soundtrack from the popular Squid Game Netflix drama is playing, perhaps a sign that this game is rigged and we have no way to legitimately win 😥😥.\n  After some testing of the game by manually playing the tic tac toe against the \u0026lsquo;AI\u0026rsquo;, and manipulating the game with some basic Cheat Engine, seems like even with a high score 1 million games won is not something that would reveal the challenge flag.\nBesides testing the game score, the game is pretty basic. Just click anywhere on the 3x3 game tile to play the game, after you win or lose, click next round. Alternatively, the score resets when you click on the \u0026lsquo;Reset\u0026rsquo; button. The game functions like how one would expect a typical tic tac toe game to, except you will never get a flag/prize even if you played beyond integer limit.\nLooks like the flag won\u0026rsquo;t come easily, and does require some 101 reversing efforts. So let\u0026rsquo;s get started.\nReversing the binary Since Detect It Easy has identified that this is a .NET application, we can make use of our handy dnSpy to deal with it. This tool is a useful debugger and .NET assembly editor and it does come with the feature to decompile .NET. This is great news, as we do not have to use tools like Ghidra or IDA Pro which would be more tedious to reverse and analyse.\n  Upon opening it on dnSpy, we can see that the code is successfully reversed. Unfortunately, we see some form of obfuscation, where things like the method names are not in plaintext.\n  This is due to the use of Confuser by the authors, which we have identified earlier. This technique is also commonly used by malware authors if they want to hinder analysis efforts. For this challenge, more specifically, it is ConfuserEx v1.0.0 which was used to obfuscate the binary. To solve this, we could use de4dot to clean up the binary.\nJust clone the GitHub and compile it, or grab a release on the internet. Then just run the command:\nPS C:\\Users\\Alice\\Desktop \u0026gt; de4dot-x64.exe .\\TicTacToe.exe  de4dot v3.1.41592.3405 Copyright (C) 2011-2015 de4dot@gmail.com Latest version and source code: https://github.com/0xd4d/de4dot  Detected Unknown Obfuscator (C:\\Users\\Alice\\Desktop\\TicTacToe.exe) Cleaning C:\\Users\\Alice\\Desktop\\TicTacToe.exe Renaming all obfuscated symbols Saving C:\\Users\\Alice\\Desktop\\TicTacToe-cleaned.exe   Finally, the code is cleaned and readable. The code is quite long, with about 1000++ lines in total. So I will just summarize what are the main points to solving this challenge.\nFirstly, at the entry point, it runs Form1 which is the main Tic Tac Toe game interface we saw earlier.\nprivate static void Main() { \tApplication.EnableVisualStyles(); \tApplication.SetCompatibleTextRenderingDefault(false); \tApplication.Run(new Form1()); } Tracing the click events, we see that for each tile of the tic tac toe clicked by the user, the code is as follows:\nprivate void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) { \tif (!this.bool_0) \t{ \tif (this.list_0.Contains(\u0026#39;1\u0026#39;)) \t{ \tthis.button1.ForeColor = Color.Lime; \tthis.button1.Text = \u0026#34;O\u0026#34;; \tthis.list_0.Remove(\u0026#39;1\u0026#39;); \tthis.method_8(); \t} \t} \telse \t{ \tthis.method_10(\u0026#39;1\u0026#39;); \tthis.method_11(); \t} }   In method_8, it does a series of if else conditions to check if the player has won the game, lost it, or if it ended in a draw, and displays the message box accordingly.\nThis can be confirmed by base64 decoding:\necho WW91IHdpbiEgUHJlc3MgTmV4dCBSb3VuZCB0byBjb250aW51ZS4= | base64 --decode  You win! Press Next Round to continue.  echo WW91IExvc2UhIFByZXNzIE5leHQgUm91bmQgdG8gY29udGludWUu | base64 --decode  You Lose! Press Next Round to continue.  echo RHJhdyEgUHJlc3MgTmV4dCBSb3VuZCB0byBjb250aW51ZS4= | base64 --decode  Draw! Press Next Round to continue. However, there is an additional if statement after the checks for win/lose/draw condition, checking if 2 integers are 3 and 2 respectively.\nif (this.int_0 == 3 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; this.int_1 == 2) { \tthis.method_9(); } Turns out that this is referring to the player score. So let\u0026rsquo;s go back to the binary and give it a play.\n  To speed things up a little, as the AI was too dumb to win me, I edited the memory to give it the desired scores of 3 and 2 for myself and the AI. This could be played manually too, though time consuming.\nUpon clicking any tiles with the score, the condition is met and a message box pops up telling us \u0026ldquo;You have accessed the hidden locker, can you unlock it?\u0026rdquo;. How fun, we have unlocked a secret stage to this game.\nClearly, this is also hinting to us that we are closer to the flag now.\nHidden Locker (Secret Stage?!) in the binary   Now, the GUI of the .NET binary has changed. This is no longer a tic tac toe game but we have a PIN pad.\nThe code does something along the lines of:\n Checking the length of the PIN to be 9 Calling method 12, which checks our PIN  private void buttonX_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) { \tif (!this.bool_0) \t{ \tif (this.list_0.Contains(\u0026#39;1\u0026#39;)) \t{ \tthis.button1.ForeColor = Color.Lime; \tthis.button1.Text = \u0026#34;O\u0026#34;; \tthis.list_0.Remove(\u0026#39;1\u0026#39;); \tthis.method_8(); \t} \t} \telse \t{ \tthis.method_10(\u0026#39;1\u0026#39;); \tthis.method_11(); \t} }  public void method_11() { \tif (this.string_0.Length == 9) \t{ \tthis.method_12(); \t} }   From here, we see that it uses the PIN along with strings in the method Y0uSh0uldPr3ssth, 3butt0ns and TtH/04xZb79By/VnbPZlBgO/D96vRmqPk0QT50gbdi8= for AesCrypto. Now this is the crypto part of the reversing challenge.\nBut firstly, we have to ensure we pass the lengthy if condition for our PIN to even trigger the decryption routine. As it would be used for decryption, there is no point patching this binary to skip the statement as it would not give us the flag even if we manipulated the if condition.\nif (num % num9 == 0 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; num9 * 3 == num2 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; num2 * 3 == num4 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; num5 % num2 == 2 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; num6 * 4 == num5 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; num2 % num4 == num3 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; num2 - num6 == num \u0026amp;\u0026amp; num7 % num3 == num \u0026amp;\u0026amp; num7 / 2 == num6 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; num8 % num2 == num9 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; num8 % num7 == num2) Since this is something very painful (and perhaps impossible to do within the CTF 12 hours) to be done manually, I have decided to use some python scripting help along with z3 black magic.\nTo install, we can simply use pip.\n pip install z3-solver Z3 is basically a theorem prover from Microsoft Research, this would help us to solve the equations given the amount of constraints imposed by the game. Please pardon me for my amateur z3 code, I am still learning it.\nfrom z3 import *  s = Solver() pin_code = IntVector(\u0026#34;x\u0026#34;, 9)  # Add constraints to z3  s.add(pin_code[0] % pin_code[8] == 0) s.add(pin_code[8] * 3 == pin_code[1]) s.add(pin_code[1] * 3 == pin_code[3]) s.add(pin_code[4] % pin_code[1] == 2) s.add(pin_code[5] * 4 == pin_code[4]) s.add(pin_code[1] % pin_code[3] == pin_code[2]) s.add(pin_code[1] - pin_code[5] == pin_code[0]) s.add(pin_code[6] % pin_code[2] == pin_code[0]) s.add(pin_code[6] / 2 == pin_code[5]) s.add(pin_code[7] % pin_code[1] == pin_code[8]) s.add(pin_code[7] % pin_code[6] == pin_code[1])  # Solve  res = s.check() if res == sat:  print(s.model()) else:  print(\u0026#34;Response: %s\u0026#34; % res) Running the z3 solver would provide us the PIN, after doing some rearrangement:\n x__3 = 9  x__4 = 8  x__1 = 3  x__8 = 1  x__5 = 2  x__6 = 4  x__0 = 1  x__7 = 7  x__2 = 3   PIN = 133982471   Finally, with the PIN cracked, we can just enter it in the game using the GUI and a message box will appear giving us the flag!\nYou have obtained the flag!

This post will also discuss some real world scenario and attack surface of the Grafana.\nBrief Analysis on the Root Cause The detailed analysis can be found at the author\u0026rsquo;s blog here, I will only briefly cover it.\nAll API routes were defined in pkg/api/api.go , some require authentication like below:\n\tr.Get(\u0026#34;/plugins\u0026#34;, reqSignedIn, hs.Index) \tr.Get(\u0026#34;/plugins/:id/\u0026#34;, reqSignedIn, hs.Index) \tr.Get(\u0026#34;/plugins/:id/edit\u0026#34;, reqSignedIn, hs.Index) // deprecated \tr.Get(\u0026#34;/plugins/:id/page/:page\u0026#34;, reqSignedIn, hs.Index) While some does not require signed in, like below:\n\t// expose plugin file system assets \tr.Get(\u0026#34;/public/plugins/:pluginId/*\u0026#34;, hs.getPluginAssets) For the route at /public/plugins/:pluginId/*, it is handled by hs.getPluginAssets, which is defined in pkg/api/plugins.go:\n// getPluginAssets returns public plugin assets (images, JS, etc.) // // /public/plugins/:pluginId/* func (hs *HTTPServer) getPluginAssets(c *models.ReqContext) { \tpluginID := web.Params(c.Req)[\u0026#34;:pluginId\u0026#34;] \tplugin, exists := hs.pluginStore.Plugin(c.Req.Context(), pluginID) \tif !exists { \tc.JsonApiErr(404, \u0026#34;Plugin not found\u0026#34;, nil) \treturn \t}  \trequestedFile := filepath.Clean(web.Params(c.Req)[\u0026#34;*\u0026#34;]) \tpluginFilePath := filepath.Join(plugin.PluginDir, requestedFile)  \tif !plugin.IncludedInSignature(requestedFile) { \ths.log.Warn(\u0026#34;Access to requested plugin file will be forbidden in upcoming Grafana versions as the file \u0026#34;+ \t\u0026#34;is not included in the plugin signature\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;file\u0026#34;, requestedFile) \t}  \t// It\u0026#39;s safe to ignore gosec warning G304 since we already clean the requested file path and subsequently \t// use this with a prefix of the plugin\u0026#39;s directory, which is set during plugin loading \t// nolint:gosec \tf, err := os.Open(pluginFilePath)   the rest are Omitted Line 5 is retrieving /public/plugins/(.*) as the pluginId, then pass to line 12 filepath.Clean to do sanitization, and concatenate in line 13, finally passed to os.Open in line 23 to read the contents.\nThe most interesting part is the comment at line 20:\n // It\u0026rsquo;s safe to ignore gosec warning G304 since we already clean the requested file path and subsequently\n If we check the document on the usage of filepath.Clean:\n  Point 4 is worthy to take note.\n replace \u0026ldquo;/..\u0026rdquo; by \u0026ldquo;/\u0026rdquo; at the beginning of a path\n What if the path does not start with /..? we can try it out:\n  It seems that filepath.Clean is not working as what the developers expect it to do, which leads to directory traversal and subsequently arbitrary file read.\nIt can be replicated in the docker environment as shown below (take note that the plugin should exist, otherwise you will get Plugin not found error. Luckily, Grafana has come with some default plugins. In the screenshot below, I am using Grafana\u0026rsquo;s welcome plugin):\n  Nginx Reverse Proxy Bypass On the day this vulnerability is getting hot amongst the security researchers (around 7th Dec, 2021), the vulnerability author posted a tweet as below:\n  But one day later, he retweeted:\n  So does Nginx help? we can set up the environment and try:\n  We are getting a 400 bad request.\nThe reason is simple: Nginx will do path normalization before it forwards the request to the backend. If the normalized URI is requesting beyond the web root directory, it will simply returns 400 bad request.\nIn the request above, /public/plugins/welcome/../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd will be normalized into /../../../../../../../etc/passwd, hence, a 400 bad request is returned.\nBut does that mean Nginx will protect Grafana against this kind of path traversal attack? May not be. It depends on how you configure the proxy_pass entry. Before I cover that, here is an example:\n  We can see that our path traversal still succeed and read the content of the sdk.ts, which is located two directories above the welcome plugin directory.\nSo here is first point, which is covered in the Nginx document\n If proxy_pass is specified without a URI, the request URI is passed to the server in the same form as sent by a client when the original request is processed\n Scroll back and examine my Nginx configuration, noticed that my proxy_pass entry is defined as http://localhost:3000, without a URI, hence, the original request will be forwarded to the Grafana backend. And in the first place, since my original URI is /public/plugins/welcome/../../sdk.ts, even after normalization by Nginx, it is /public/sdk.ts, which is a valid URI, hence, Nginx will not complain about it either.\nThis allows us to read arbitrary files up to three directory above the plugin directories. But the default plugin directories is deep at /usr/share/grafana/public/app/plugins/{plugin_id}, even being able to traverse up by 3 directories, there aren\u0026rsquo;t many files to read.\nSo here is the second point, which is covered in this post\n URL consists of scheme:[//authority]path[?query][#fragment], and browsers don’t send #fragment. But how must a reverse proxy handle #fragment?\nNginx throws fragment off\n So what would happen if my URI is /public/plugins/welcome/#/../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd?\nNginx will process until /public/plugins/welcome/, and forward the entire URI to the Grafana backend, and leads to path traversal all the way up to the root directory:\n  Attack Surface under Grafana In this section, we try to examine the possible attack surface under Grafana when we are able to read files on the file system.\nGrafana Database We can try to read the database file, which is located at /var/lib/grafana/grafana.db by default, which is a sqlite database:\n  So, what is inside the Grafana database?\nuser table:   The password is hard to decrypt, using a slow hash algorithm with salt as defined in pkg/util/encoding.go:\n// EncodePassword encodes a password using PBKDF2. func EncodePassword(password string, salt string) (string, error) { \tnewPasswd := pbkdf2.Key([]byte(password), []byte(salt), 10000, 50, sha256.New) \treturn hex.EncodeToString(newPasswd), nil } user_auth_token: It seems that user_auth_token is also stored as one-way hash, as defined in /pkg/services/auth/auth_token.go:\nfunc hashToken(token string) string { \thashBytes := sha256.Sum256([]byte(token + setting.SecretKey)) \treturn hex.EncodeToString(hashBytes[:]) } I can\u0026rsquo;t think of a way to exploit this, if possible, please tell me =)\ndata_source:   The data_source tells Grafana where to pull the data from.\nFinally there is something that we can exploit. In /pkg/cmd/grafana-cli/commands/datamigrations/encrypt_datasource_passwords_test.go:\nfunc DecryptSecureJsonData(ds *models.DataSource) (map[string]string, error) { \tdecrypted := make(map[string]string) \tfor key, data := range ds.SecureJsonData { \tdecryptedData, err := util.Decrypt(data, setting.SecretKey) \tif err != nil { \treturn nil, err \t}  \tdecrypted[key] = string(decryptedData) \t} \treturn decrypted, nil } util.Decrypt is defined in /pkg/util/encryption.go, you can re-use it to decrypt the encrypted password in the data source, or you can use the script here:\n  The secretkey is defined in the Grafana\u0026rsquo;s configuration file, which is located at /etc/grafana/grafana.ini, and it might contains other sensitive information as well. We will cover those next\nGrafana Configuration File Located at /etc/grafana/grafana.ini by default, which might contain several sensitive information. You can take a look at the default configuration file here and see what can be stored inside. I won\u0026rsquo;t go through them one by one.\ngrafana-image-renderer Apart from the various credentials that could be leaked from the Grafana\u0026rsquo;s configuration file, another worth-mentioning entry is the grafana-image-renderer\n[rendering] # Options to configure a remote HTTP image rendering service, e.g. using https://github.com/grafana/grafana-image-renderer. # URL to a remote HTTP image renderer service, e.g. http://localhost:8081/render, will enable Grafana to render panels and dashboards to PNG-images using HTTP requests to an external service. server_url = # If the remote HTTP image renderer service runs on a different server than the Grafana server you may have to configure this to a URL where Grafana is reachable, e.g. http://grafana.domain/. callback_url = # Concurrent render request limit affects when the /render HTTP endpoint is used. Rendering many images at the same time can overload the server, # which this setting can help protect against by only allowing a certain amount of concurrent requests. concurrent_render_request_limit = 30 grafana-image-renderer is a remote HTTP image rendering service, which you can ask the renderer to visit the Grafana panel, render into image and send to us.\nThe official guideline is to set up the grafana-image-renderer service inside a separate docker, and link it to the Grafana docker using Docker Compose like below:\nversion: \u0026#39;2\u0026#39; services: grafana: image: grafana/grafana:latest ports: - \u0026#39;3000:3000\u0026#39; environment: GF_RENDERING_SERVER_URL: http://renderer:8081/render GF_RENDERING_CALLBACK_URL: http://grafana:3000/ GF_LOG_FILTERS: rendering:debug renderer: image: grafana/grafana-image-renderer:latest ports: - 8081 Under this configuration, the renderer service is inaccessible from the Internet.\nHowever, there is another option to run it as a standalone Node.js application.\n  It seems that the service is also listening on the localhost, but actually it is accessible via public network interface:\n  Exposing a renderer that attackers can specify any host for it to visit is not that dangerous unless you are running an outdated renderer:\n  And without sandbox:\n  So RCE is achievable:\n  Reference https://grafana.com/blog/2021/12/08/an-update-on-0day-cve-2021-43798-grafana-directory-traversal/\nhttps://j0vsec.com/post/cve-2021-43798/\nhttps://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/dqJ3F_fStlj78S0qhQ3Ggw\nhttps://pkg.go.dev/path/filepath\nhttps://www.acunetix.com/blog/articles/a-fresh-look-on-reverse-proxy-related-attacks/\nhttps://articles.zsxq.com/id_jb6bwow4zf5p.html\nhttps://articles.zsxq.com/id_baeb9hmiroq5.html\nhttps://github.com/jas502n/Grafana-CVE-2021-43798\nhttps://securitylab.github.com/research/in_the_wild_chrome_cve_2021_30632/\n","permalink":"https://nusgreyhats.org/posts/writeups/a-not-so-deep-dive-in-to-grafana-cve-2021-43798/","summary":"Overview This post will cover some details behind the recent Grafana vulnerability (CVE-2021-43798), which is a directory traversal bug allowing unauthenticated attackers to read files on the target server filesystem.

It is a windows console application that will validate user input and checks the flag entered. I will go into a bit more details since this is a write up for beginners rather than experienced reverse engineers.\n  Understanding the target The first step to reverse engineering is figuring out how the target binary is constructed. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to waste our time reversing a packer or .NET bytecodes in IDA. So, I used Detect It Easy to check the binary.\n  It\u0026rsquo;s written in C++ which may have some mangled functions and complicated classes. But it is not that bad to reverse engineer in a classic decompiler like IDA or Ghidra.\nDecompile Loading the binary in IDA, I can see most of the logic is actually written in the main method. That saved me a lot of time as there is not much structures or classes to worry about which tends to be the most time consuming part of reverse engineering a C++ program.\nAs the main method is fairly long, I will just copy paste the IDA decompilation output here.\nint __cdecl main(int argc, const char **argv, const char **envp) {  // [COLLAPSED LOCAL DECLARATIONS.

It is essentially doing the following:\nfor i in range (34): \tuser_input[i] = user_input[i] ^ key[i%16] Then, the while block following the xor operations:\nv7 = 0i64; v8 = v3 - byte_140004508; while ( byte_140004508[v7] == byte_140004508[v7 + v8] ) {  if ( ++v7 \u0026gt;= 34 )  {  v9 = \u0026#34;Nice.

It is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to induce a server side application to make a HTTP request to a domain of the attacker\u0026rsquo;s choosing.\nTypically, the attacker will target the server\u0026rsquo;s internal only services.\nWhy SSRF?   SSRF trend   Between 2017 to 2021, SSRF have been in the rise and is a new contender in the OWASP top 10.\nSome possible explainations might be the rise of the cloud and microservices architecture.\nA large amount of information today is hosted on the cloud to improve deployment times, high application uptimes as well as autoscaling with technologies such as kubernetes.\nWith the microservices architecture, big services are split up into multiple smaller microservices where each microservice is used to maintain one function of the larger services. The microservices usually communicate with each other over HTTP or other lightweight protocols.\nThis microservices architecture provides a large surface for the attacker to attempt to exploit SSRF. Any single vulnerable service will allow the attacker to access multiple microservices. With more services communicating with each other, the attacker will have a higher chance of finding a more impactful exploit.\nGeneral Impact The impact of SSRF is generally an attack on the server itself or other internal services that can be accessed from the server.\nHow does SSRF work?   SSRF   Although the attacker is unable to access the internal services directly, the attacker can still reach the other internal services through the vulnerable web servers.\nIn the diagram above, the attacker sends a malicious packet to the server to induce the server to make a request to other internal services (Either 1 or 2).\nThis usually occurs due to the lack of sanitization of user input especially when it comes to URLs. For example, if there is a web service that allows other users to convert a webpage into a PDF, the attacker can send the ip address of an internal service to view what is available on the other internal services.\nAn example of such a scenerio is CVE-2020-7740 which affects all versions of node-pdf-generator.\nIn this case, there is no sanitization of the user\u0026rsquo;s url before generating the PDF.\nfunction acceptHtmlAndProvidePdf(request, response) {  console.log(\u0026#39;Request received: \u0026#39; + request);   request.content = \u0026#39;\u0026#39;;   request.addListener(\u0026#34;data\u0026#34;, function (chunk) {  if (chunk) {  request.content += chunk;  }  // Lack of checks here  });   request.addListener(\u0026#34;end\u0026#34;, function () {   var options = {  encoding: \u0026#39;utf-8\u0026#39;,  pageSize: request.headers[\u0026#39;x-page-size\u0026#39;] || \u0026#39;Letter\u0026#39;  };   response.writeHead(200, { \u0026#39;Content-Type\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;application/pdf\u0026#39; });   htmlToPdf(request.content, options)  .pipe(response);   console.log(\u0026#39;Processed HTML to PDF: \u0026#39; + response);  }); } This allows the attacker to forge a server request as the script fetches the information from the webpage to convert to PDF.\nWhat is the impact of SSRF The impact of SSRF can widely vary depending on different circumstances.\n Denial of Service Remote Code execution Bypassing access control Port Scanning: Reqeusts can be made to different ports and the resulting status code or result shown on the frontend allows the attacker to infer if the port is open Other internal services (Details on the attacks are given in the references below)  Redis: If Redis uses a text based protocol (RESP), the attacker can send a payload with the correct format and send commands to the redis server. Cloud metadata: Metadata API base url can be given to the vulnerable server to retrieve information about the server.    Types of SSRF There are mainly 3 different types of SSRF vulnerabilities.\n Basic SSRF: The result is returned to the frontend and can be seen by the user. Blind SSRF: The result of the attack is not returned to the frontend. Semi-Blind SSRF: The attacker only knows if the payload was successful or not. No details are given.  Comparison between Different Types of SSRF    Criteria Basic SSRF Blind SSRF Semi-Blind SSRF     Can the attacker directly view the page Yes No No   Difficulty of exploitation (In general) Lower Higher Medium    Example of a Basic SSRF An example of a basic SSRF exploit can be found here\nIn this example, the exposed service is running a PDF generation service. It takes in a URL from the user without sanitization and generates a PDF based on the link that it receives.\nWithin the same local environment, there is also another service that is running on localhost:5001 that contains a web server that is only accessible internally.\nBy passing the url of this internal service into the PDF generation service, the attacker can generate a PDF of the webpage that is hosted on the internal service.\nExample of a Blind SSRF An example of a blind SSRF exploit can be found here\nIn this example, the exposed service is a reporting server where users report suspicious attacks to the administrator.\nThe server automatically goes to the website and take a screenshot of the website before generating a markdown file for the admin to view.\nWhich this may seem like a good idea, a request from the server is forged in the process of taking the screenshot.\nAlthough this is harder to exploit compared to the basic SSRF, it can still lead to remote code execution under correct circumstances.\nMitigations for SSRF  Input validation (Sanitization) for URLs given by the user.  This can be in the form of a whitelist or a blacklist (There is a different list of caveats for blacklists) Verification that IP / Domain is not an internal IP address / invalid address.   Do not accept complete URLs from users. Firewall filters to prevent access of unauthorised domains  Bypasses for Mitigations However, for each the mitigations, there might be some bypasses which can be used to reduce the effectiveness of the mitigations.\n Usage of malformed URLs  {domain}@127.0.0.1 or 127.0.1 all redirects to localhost. There are multiple encodings of this url. Similar methods can be used for other urls.   DNS rebinding  The attacker can register a domain and point it to a non-blacklisted website. After the server checks that the domain is valid, the attacker can change it to point to an internal ip address. When the server visits the domain again, the server will visit the internal ip address. More information can be found below   Open Redirect  If there is another open redirection on the page, the open redirection can be used to bypass restrictions on the webpage.   Bypass via Redirection  There might be filtering when it comes to a URL. This can be used to bypass url filters by registering a valid url which bypasses the various types of filtering.   SSRF via Referrer header  Sometimes web applications make use of server side analytics software that tracks visitors. These software logs the referrer header in the request and actually visit the websites to analyze the contents of referrer sites.

So, I need a debugger.\nI am quite familiar with GDB, and there are nice extensions like GEF out there. However, Apple made it so difficult to compile a usable GDB on macOS\u0026hellip; 😑 We are pretty much forced to use LLDB (which I really don\u0026rsquo;t like).\nAnyways, beggars can\u0026rsquo;t be choosers, and vanilla GDB/LLDB is not really usable in the long run, so being able to use the scripting interface is very important. Similar to GDB, LLDB also has a Python scripting interface. Instead of .gdbinit, LLDB loads commands from .lldbinit during startup. There is a great lldbinit project that contains many custom commands which makes LLDB so much nicer to use, and I have a fork of it.\n(It is such a pain to even set breakpoints, vanilla LLDB is just not usable imo.)\nLLDB Architecture and Python Bindings Having the lldbinit extension is good. Being able to add my own custom commands is even better. To do so, I had to understand the architecture of the scripting interface.\nThe LLDB scripting interface is quite tidy. Everything is grouped into modules. Quoting the docs, here are less than half of the modules:\n SBAddress  A section + offset based address class.   SBBreakpoint  Represents a logical breakpoint and its associated settings.   SBBreakpointList  Proxy of C++ lldb::SBBreakpointList class   SBBreakpointLocation  Represents one unique instance (by address) of a logical breakpoint.   SBCommandInterpreter  SBCommandInterpreter handles/interprets commands for lldb.   SBCommandReturnObject  Represents a container which holds the result from command execution.    Feels like writing C++ but in Python. And the basic architecture is as follows:\nLLDB design: ------------| lldb -\u0026gt; debugger -\u0026gt; target -\u0026gt; process -\u0026gt; thread -\u0026gt; frame(s) -\u0026gt; thread -\u0026gt; frame(s)  LLDB talks to the debugger object debugger holds a target target holds a process process holds multiple threads and lastly, each thread has one or more frames  With more details (quoting the docs):\n SBTarget: Represents the target program running under the debugger.  Gives information about the executable, process, modules, memory, breakpoints, etc There\u0026rsquo;s a lot, check the docs   SBProcess: Represents the process associated with the target program.  Gives information about the process, memory Some overlap with the above, but this one doesn\u0026rsquo;t have modules nor breakpoints Check the docs   SBThread: Represents a thread of execution.  Gives information about a thread, e.g. thread ID Exposes functions for stepping (step in, step over, etc) and suspending/resuming Contains stack frame(s) (according to docs, it is possible to have more than 1, but I always see just 1) Check out the docs   SBFrame: Represents one of the stack frames associated with a thread.  Gives information about a stack frame, e.g. registers, functions, symbols, disassembly, etc This is a really useful module because of the information it gives. Check out the docs    Now, some useful functions to access the objects mentioned above (defined by lldbinit):\n SBTarget - get_target() SBProcess - get_process() SBThread - get_thread() SBFrame - get_frame()  Yea, quite easy.\nCreate Custom Commands To define a new command, it is as simple as creating a function in lldbinit.py. For example, to create a command called newcmd:\ndef cmd_newcmd(debugger, command, result, _dict):  args = command.split(\u0026#39; \u0026#39;)  if len(args) \u0026lt; 1:  print(\u0026#39;newcmd \u0026lt;expression\u0026gt;\u0026#39;)  return   ... Then, the function must be registered as a command in the __lldb_init_module method:\ndef __lldb_init_module(debugger, internal_dict):  ...  ci.HandleCommand(\u0026#34;command script add -f lldbinit.cmd_newcmd newcmd\u0026#34;, res)  ... The function name can be anything, but by convention all command functions in lldbinit go by cmd_\u0026lt;command name\u0026gt;.\nThe function arguments result and _dict might be useful but I don\u0026rsquo;t use them. debugger is the LLDB debugger object mentioned earlier, and command is the exact command string entered by the user.\nWe can use the API listed above to obtain information about the target/process/thread/frame, or perform actions such as setting breakpoints, stepping through instructions, etc.\nExample 1: Reading Memory Here\u0026rsquo;s a simple command I wrote to print unicode strings from memory (similar to x/s but printing unicode strings).\ndef cmd_xu(debugger, command, result, _dict):  args = command.split(\u0026#39; \u0026#39;)  if len(args) \u0026lt; 1:  print(\u0026#39;xu \u0026lt;expression\u0026gt;\u0026#39;)  return   addr = int(get_frame().EvaluateExpression(args[0]).GetValue(), 10)  error = lldb.SBError()   ended = False  s = u\u0026#39;\u0026#39;  offset = 0   while not ended:  mem = get_target().GetProcess().ReadMemory(addr + offset, 100, error)  for i in range(0, 100, 2):  wc = mem[i+1] \u0026lt;\u0026lt; 8 | mem[i]  s += chr(wc)  if wc == 0:  ended = True  break   offset += 100   print(s) Example 2: Alias It is also possible to make aliases for long commands. For example, an alias for disabling breakpoints, through the SBCommandInterpreter object obtained via the debugger.GetCommandInterpreter() method.\n# disable breakpoint number def cmd_bpd(debugger, command, result, dict):  res = lldb.SBCommandReturnObject()  debugger.GetCommandInterpreter().HandleCommand(\u0026#34;breakpoint disable \u0026#34; + command, res)  print(res.GetOutput()) Example 3: Function Tracing Lastly, here is an example of a more complicated command I wrote to get the list of functions called by the target. This is useful when I am attaching LLDB to Safari, and want to know the functions in a library that were called by Safari when loading a webpage.\nFor example, to see the functions in CoreGraphics called when browsing Wikipedia:\n(lldbinit) cz CoreGraphics [+] Creating breakpoints for all symbols in CoreGraphics [+] Done creating breakpoints for all symbols in CoreGraphics 0x7fff2505d324: | CoreGraphics CGColorSpaceUsesExtendedRange |__ WebKit WebKit::ShareableBitmap::calculateBytesPerRow(WebCore::IntSize, WebKit::ShareableBitmap::Configuration const\u0026amp;) 0x7fff2504a997: | CoreGraphics CGColorSpaceGetNumberOfComponents |__ QuartzCore CABackingStorePrepareUpdates_(CABackingStore*, unsigned long, unsigned long, unsigned int, unsigned int, unsigned int, unsigned long long, CA::GenericContext*, UpdateState*) 0x7fff250496fc: | CoreGraphics CGColorSpaceRetain |__ QuartzCore CA::CG::IOSurfaceDrawable::IOSurfaceDrawable(__IOSurface*, unsigned int, unsigned int, CGColorSpace*, int, int, unsigned int, unsigned int) 0x7fff2549cd24: | CoreGraphics CFRetain |__ CoreGraphics CGColorSpaceRetain 0x7fff2504971c: | CoreGraphics cs_retain_count |__ CoreFoundation _CFRetain 0x7fff2504e3d8: | CoreGraphics CGColorSpaceRelease |__ QuartzCore CABackingStorePrepareUpdates_(CABackingStore*, unsigned long, unsigned long, unsigned int, unsigned int, unsigned int, unsigned long long, CA::GenericContext*, UpdateState*) 0x7fff2505fdd1: | CoreGraphics CGSNewEmptyRegion |__ QuartzCore CABackingStorePrepareUpdates_(CABackingStore*, unsigned long, unsigned long, unsigned int, unsigned int, unsigned int, unsigned long long, CA::GenericContext*, UpdateState*) ... def cmd_cz(debugger, command, result, _dict):  args = command.split(\u0026#39; \u0026#39;)  if len(args) \u0026lt; 1:  print(\u0026#39;cov \u0026lt;module name\u0026gt;\u0026#39;)  return   module_name = args[0]  target = debugger.GetSelectedTarget()  module = find_module_by_name(get_target(), module_name)   # to keep track of the breakpoints set  bpmap = {}  print(\u0026#34;[+] Creating breakpoints for all symbols in\u0026#34;, module_name)  for symbol in module:  sym_name = symbol.GetName()  if sym_name.startswith(\u0026#34;os\u0026#34;) or \u0026#34;pthread\u0026#34; in sym_name or \u0026#34;lock\u0026#34; in sym_name or \u0026#34;operator\u0026#34; in sym_name:  continue  address = symbol.GetStartAddress().GetLoadAddress(target)  bp = target.BreakpointCreateByAddress(address)  bpmap[address] = bp  print(\u0026#34;[+] Done creating breakpoints for all symbols in\u0026#34;, module_name)   visited = []  while True:  get_process().Continue()   thread = get_thread()  rip = int(str(get_frame().reg[\u0026#34;rip\u0026#34;].value), 16)   if rip in visited:  continue   if rip not in bpmap.keys():  print(\u0026#34;[+] Dead\u0026#34;) # crashed or something  break  # disable breakpoint after reaching it one time  bpmap[rip].SetEnabled(False)   print(hex(rip) + \u0026#34;:\u0026#34;)  for i in range(2):  frame = thread.GetFrameAtIndex(i)  symbol = frame.GetSymbol()  module = frame.GetModule().GetFileSpec().GetFilename()   print(\u0026#34;|\u0026#34; + \u0026#34;__\u0026#34; * i, module, symbol.GetName()) In this example, I created a breakpoint using target.BreakpointCreateByAddress(address), by using the SBSymbol methods to get a function\u0026rsquo;s address in the process.

We see a variety of cyber threats from terrorists, criminal, and state-sponsored organisations, especially as Covid-19 has forced many of us to work, learn, and play from home, on our mobile and electronic devices.","title":"SecWed #180821"},{"content":"   Talk 1: 1900Hrs - 1945Hrs Talk Title: Greyhats Introduction\nDo you find yourself wondering what the Greyhats team is often up to?

So, what about the technical details? In this talk, I will describe the details of Enigma \u0026amp; Bombe, up to the point that we could simulate them. While the experiences on both machines likely shaped development of modern cryptography, we probably won’t need such electro-mechanical system anymore. Nonetheless, it would be a fun topic to kickstart this seminar series.\nSpeaker Ee-Chien Chang is an Associate Professor in the School of Computing at National University of Singapore (NUS).
