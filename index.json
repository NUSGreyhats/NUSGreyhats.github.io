So, I need a debugger.\nI am quite familiar with GDB, and there are nice extensions like GEF out there. However, Apple made it so difficult to compile a usable GDB on macOS\u0026hellip; 😑 We are pretty much forced to use LLDB (which I really don\u0026rsquo;t like).\nAnyways, beggars can\u0026rsquo;t be choosers, and vanilla GDB/LLDB is not really usable in the long run, so being able to use the scripting interface is very important. Similar to GDB, LLDB also has a Python scripting interface. Instead of .gdbinit, LLDB loads commands from .lldbinit during startup. There is a great lldbinit project that contains many custom commands which makes LLDB so much nicer to use, and I have a fork of it.\n(It is such a pain to even set breakpoints, vanilla LLDB is just not usable imo.)\nLLDB Architecture and Python Bindings Having the lldbinit extension is good. Being able to add my own custom commands is even better. To do so, I had to understand the architecture of the scripting interface.\nThe LLDB scripting interface is quite tidy. Everything is grouped into modules. Quoting the docs, here are less than half of the modules:\n SBAddress  A section + offset based address class.   SBBreakpoint  Represents a logical breakpoint and its associated settings.   SBBreakpointList  Proxy of C++ lldb::SBBreakpointList class   SBBreakpointLocation  Represents one unique instance (by address) of a logical breakpoint.   SBCommandInterpreter  SBCommandInterpreter handles/interprets commands for lldb.   SBCommandReturnObject  Represents a container which holds the result from command execution.    Feels like writing C++ but in Python. And the basic architecture is as follows:\nLLDB design: ------------| lldb -\u0026gt; debugger -\u0026gt; target -\u0026gt; process -\u0026gt; thread -\u0026gt; frame(s) -\u0026gt; thread -\u0026gt; frame(s)  LLDB talks to the debugger object debugger holds a target target holds a process process holds multiple threads and lastly, each thread has one or more frames  With more details (quoting the docs):\n SBTarget: Represents the target program running under the debugger.  Gives information about the executable, process, modules, memory, breakpoints, etc There\u0026rsquo;s a lot, check the docs   SBProcess: Represents the process associated with the target program.  Gives information about the process, memory Some overlap with the above, but this one doesn\u0026rsquo;t have modules nor breakpoints Check the docs   SBThread: Represents a thread of execution.  Gives information about a thread, e.g. thread ID Exposes functions for stepping (step in, step over, etc) and suspending/resuming Contains stack frame(s) (according to docs, it is possible to have more than 1, but I always see just 1) Check out the docs   SBFrame: Represents one of the stack frames associated with a thread.  Gives information about a stack frame, e.g. registers, functions, symbols, disassembly, etc This is a really useful module because of the information it gives. Check out the docs    Now, some useful functions to access the objects mentioned above (defined by lldbinit):\n SBTarget - get_target() SBProcess - get_process() SBThread - get_thread() SBFrame - get_frame()  Yea, quite easy.\nCreate Custom Commands To define a new command, it is as simple as creating a function in lldbinit.py. For example, to create a command called newcmd:\ndef cmd_newcmd(debugger, command, result, _dict): args = command.split(\u0026#39; \u0026#39;) if len(args) \u0026lt; 1: print(\u0026#39;newcmd \u0026lt;expression\u0026gt;\u0026#39;) return ... Then, the function must be registered as a command in the __lldb_init_module method:\ndef __lldb_init_module(debugger, internal_dict): ... ci.HandleCommand(\u0026#34;command script add -f lldbinit.cmd_newcmd newcmd\u0026#34;, res) ... The function name can be anything, but by convention all command functions in lldbinit go by cmd_\u0026lt;command name\u0026gt;.\nThe function arguments result and _dict might be useful but I don\u0026rsquo;t use them. debugger is the LLDB debugger object mentioned earlier, and command is the exact command string entered by the user.\nWe can use the API listed above to obtain information about the target/process/thread/frame, or perform actions such as setting breakpoints, stepping through instructions, etc.\nExample 1: Reading Memory Here\u0026rsquo;s a simple command I wrote to print unicode strings from memory (similar to x/s but printing unicode strings).\ndef cmd_xu(debugger, command, result, _dict): args = command.split(\u0026#39; \u0026#39;) if len(args) \u0026lt; 1: print(\u0026#39;xu \u0026lt;expression\u0026gt;\u0026#39;) return addr = int(get_frame().EvaluateExpression(args[0]).GetValue(), 10) error = lldb.SBError() ended = False s = u\u0026#39;\u0026#39; offset = 0 while not ended: mem = get_target().GetProcess().ReadMemory(addr + offset, 100, error) for i in range(0, 100, 2): wc = mem[i+1] \u0026lt;\u0026lt; 8 | mem[i] s += chr(wc) if wc == 0: ended = True break offset += 100 print(s) Example 2: Alias It is also possible to make aliases for long commands. For example, an alias for disabling breakpoints, through the SBCommandInterpreter object obtained via the debugger.GetCommandInterpreter() method.\n# disable breakpoint number def cmd_bpd(debugger, command, result, dict): res = lldb.SBCommandReturnObject() debugger.GetCommandInterpreter().HandleCommand(\u0026#34;breakpoint disable \u0026#34; + command, res) print(res.GetOutput()) Example 3: Function Tracing Lastly, here is an example of a more complicated command I wrote to get the list of functions called by the target. This is useful when I am attaching LLDB to Safari, and want to know the functions in a library that were called by Safari when loading a webpage.\nFor example, to see the functions in CoreGraphics called when browsing Wikipedia:\n(lldbinit) cz CoreGraphics [+] Creating breakpoints for all symbols in CoreGraphics [+] Done creating breakpoints for all symbols in CoreGraphics 0x7fff2505d324: | CoreGraphics CGColorSpaceUsesExtendedRange |__ WebKit WebKit::ShareableBitmap::calculateBytesPerRow(WebCore::IntSize, WebKit::ShareableBitmap::Configuration const\u0026amp;) 0x7fff2504a997: | CoreGraphics CGColorSpaceGetNumberOfComponents |__ QuartzCore CABackingStorePrepareUpdates_(CABackingStore*, unsigned long, unsigned long, unsigned int, unsigned int, unsigned int, unsigned long long, CA::GenericContext*, UpdateState*) 0x7fff250496fc: | CoreGraphics CGColorSpaceRetain |__ QuartzCore CA::CG::IOSurfaceDrawable::IOSurfaceDrawable(__IOSurface*, unsigned int, unsigned int, CGColorSpace*, int, int, unsigned int, unsigned int) 0x7fff2549cd24: | CoreGraphics CFRetain |__ CoreGraphics CGColorSpaceRetain 0x7fff2504971c: | CoreGraphics cs_retain_count |__ CoreFoundation _CFRetain 0x7fff2504e3d8: | CoreGraphics CGColorSpaceRelease |__ QuartzCore CABackingStorePrepareUpdates_(CABackingStore*, unsigned long, unsigned long, unsigned int, unsigned int, unsigned int, unsigned long long, CA::GenericContext*, UpdateState*) 0x7fff2505fdd1: | CoreGraphics CGSNewEmptyRegion |__ QuartzCore CABackingStorePrepareUpdates_(CABackingStore*, unsigned long, unsigned long, unsigned int, unsigned int, unsigned int, unsigned long long, CA::GenericContext*, UpdateState*) ... def cmd_cz(debugger, command, result, _dict): args = command.split(\u0026#39; \u0026#39;) if len(args) \u0026lt; 1: print(\u0026#39;cov \u0026lt;module name\u0026gt;\u0026#39;) return module_name = args[0] target = debugger.GetSelectedTarget() module = find_module_by_name(get_target(), module_name) # to keep track of the breakpoints set bpmap = {} print(\u0026#34;[+] Creating breakpoints for all symbols in\u0026#34;, module_name) for symbol in module: sym_name = symbol.GetName() if sym_name.startswith(\u0026#34;os\u0026#34;) or \u0026#34;pthread\u0026#34; in sym_name or \u0026#34;lock\u0026#34; in sym_name or \u0026#34;operator\u0026#34; in sym_name: continue address = symbol.GetStartAddress().GetLoadAddress(target) bp = target.BreakpointCreateByAddress(address) bpmap[address] = bp print(\u0026#34;[+] Done creating breakpoints for all symbols in\u0026#34;, module_name) visited = [] while True: get_process().Continue() thread = get_thread() rip = int(str(get_frame().reg[\u0026#34;rip\u0026#34;].value), 16) if rip in visited: continue if rip not in bpmap.keys(): print(\u0026#34;[+] Dead\u0026#34;) # crashed or something break # disable breakpoint after reaching it one time bpmap[rip].SetEnabled(False) print(hex(rip) + \u0026#34;:\u0026#34;) for i in range(2): frame = thread.GetFrameAtIndex(i) symbol = frame.GetSymbol() module = frame.GetModule().GetFileSpec().GetFilename() print(\u0026#34;|\u0026#34; + \u0026#34;__\u0026#34; * i, module, symbol.GetName()) In this example, I created a breakpoint using target.BreakpointCreateByAddress(address), by using the SBSymbol methods to get a function\u0026rsquo;s address in the process. I also used the lldbinit helper function find_module_by_name to get a SBModule object given a module name.\nThere were more unmentioned API calls used by this command, read the code to learn more if you are interested.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s all.

Nonetheless, most machine learning models are vulnerable towards attacks using adversarial samples. A smallest perturbation on the input, such as change of a pixel’s value, could cause the model to give the wrong result. In this talk, I will give a brief introduction about some of the adversarial attacks and discuss what we can do to mitigate them.\nBio Jiyi graduated from NUS School of Computing in 2018 with first class honors.

There is no such number $$a$$ such that $$3 \\cdot a \\equiv 1 \\mod 6$$ The number 3 and 2 is a zero divisor. $$3 \\cdot 2 \\equiv 0 \\mod 6$$  You need to be very careful for the choice of your Ring/Field as some functions are only valid for field but not for ring.\nIn general, field are easier to work with as it has more properties.
