[{"content":"Overview The HTX Investigators’ Challenge (HTXIC) 2021 was a CTF competition with about ~128 teams participating, it was held online on 20 Dec 2021. This post will document a writeup on the challenge Reversing 101 as I thought it is quite a fun to reverse a tic tac toe game and find flag.\n  PS: The CTF came in a mixed reality/game world concept where instead of the usual web portal where we submit our flags, it is done in a Unity game mirroring the HTX Office in real life. We get to see our teammates in game too in various avatars and have to uncover/hunt for \u0026lsquo;quests\u0026rsquo; in game to unlock the CTF challenges. Other than the lack of features in-game like the ability to chat, this CTF was quite a novel one replacing the face to face physical competitions in this COVID-19 pandemic.\nUnderstanding the binary Since the challenge title already hints that this is a reversing challenge, we can first analyse the binary to know what we are dealing with.\nUploading the file onto VirusTotal is a easy way to figure it, so upon upload we get the following:\n  Access the full VirusTotal Report here\nIndicating that this binary is a PE32 executable for MS Windows (GUI) Intel 80386 32-bit Mono/.Net assembly.\n  We can verify this using local tools as well, for example on Detect It Easy, identifying it to be a .NET(v4.0.30319) binary. This would mean that we can test this binary out on a Windows VM. Interestingly, Confuser(1.X) was also identified, this will be useful later.\nTesting the binary Before going into reversing the program, let\u0026rsquo;s first understand what it does.\n  Launching the program, we expectedly get a GUI program showing a Tic Tac Toe game. The symbols and font of the game looks suspicious, and in the background a familiar soundtrack from the popular Squid Game Netflix drama is playing, perhaps a sign that this game is rigged and we have no way to legitimately win 😥😥.\n  After some testing of the game by manually playing the tic tac toe against the \u0026lsquo;AI\u0026rsquo;, and manipulating the game with some basic Cheat Engine, seems like even with a high score 1 million games won is not something that would reveal the challenge flag.\nBesides testing the game score, the game is pretty basic. Just click anywhere on the 3x3 game tile to play the game, after you win or lose, click next round. Alternatively, the score resets when you click on the \u0026lsquo;Reset\u0026rsquo; button. The game functions like how one would expect a typical tic tac toe game to, except you will never get a flag/prize even if you played beyond integer limit.\nLooks like the flag won\u0026rsquo;t come easily, and does require some 101 reversing efforts. So let\u0026rsquo;s get started.\nReversing the binary Since Detect It Easy has identified that this is a .NET application, we can make use of our handy dnSpy to deal with it. This tool is a useful debugger and .NET assembly editor and it does come with the feature to decompile .NET. This is great news, as we do not have to use tools like Ghidra or IDA Pro which would be more tedious to reverse and analyse.\n  Upon opening it on dnSpy, we can see that the code is successfully reversed. Unfortunately, we see some form of obfuscation, where things like the method names are not in plaintext.\n  This is due to the use of Confuser by the authors, which we have identified earlier. This technique is also commonly used by malware authors if they want to hinder analysis efforts. For this challenge, more specifically, it is ConfuserEx v1.0.0 which was used to obfuscate the binary. To solve this, we could use de4dot to clean up the binary.\nJust clone the GitHub and compile it, or grab a release on the internet. Then just run the command:\nPS C:\\Users\\Alice\\Desktop \u0026gt; de4dot-x64.exe .\\TicTacToe.exe de4dot v3.1.41592.3405 Copyright (C) 2011-2015 de4dot@gmail.com Latest version and source code: https://github.com/0xd4d/de4dot Detected Unknown Obfuscator (C:\\Users\\Alice\\Desktop\\TicTacToe.exe) Cleaning C:\\Users\\Alice\\Desktop\\TicTacToe.exe Renaming all obfuscated symbols Saving C:\\Users\\Alice\\Desktop\\TicTacToe-cleaned.exe   Finally, the code is cleaned and readable. The code is quite long, with about 1000++ lines in total. So I will just summarize what are the main points to solving this challenge.\nFirstly, at the entry point, it runs Form1 which is the main Tic Tac Toe game interface we saw earlier.\nprivate static void Main() { Application.EnableVisualStyles(); Application.SetCompatibleTextRenderingDefault(false); Application.Run(new Form1()); } Tracing the click events, we see that for each tile of the tic tac toe clicked by the user, the code is as follows:\nprivate void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) { if (!this.bool_0) { if (this.list_0.Contains(\u0026#39;1\u0026#39;)) { this.button1.ForeColor = Color.Lime; this.button1.Text = \u0026#34;O\u0026#34;; this.list_0.Remove(\u0026#39;1\u0026#39;); this.method_8(); } } else { this.method_10(\u0026#39;1\u0026#39;); this.method_11(); } }   In method_8, it does a series of if else conditions to check if the player has won the game, lost it, or if it ended in a draw, and displays the message box accordingly.\nThis can be confirmed by base64 decoding:\necho WW91IHdpbiEgUHJlc3MgTmV4dCBSb3VuZCB0byBjb250aW51ZS4= | base64 --decode You win! Press Next Round to continue. echo WW91IExvc2UhIFByZXNzIE5leHQgUm91bmQgdG8gY29udGludWUu | base64 --decode You Lose! Press Next Round to continue. echo RHJhdyEgUHJlc3MgTmV4dCBSb3VuZCB0byBjb250aW51ZS4= | base64 --decode Draw! Press Next Round to continue. However, there is an additional if statement after the checks for win/lose/draw condition, checking if 2 integers are 3 and 2 respectively.\nif (this.int_0 == 3 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; this.int_1 == 2) { this.method_9(); } Turns out that this is referring to the player score. So let\u0026rsquo;s go back to the binary and give it a play.\n  To speed things up a little, as the AI was too dumb to win me, I edited the memory to give it the desired scores of 3 and 2 for myself and the AI. This could be played manually too, though time consuming.\nUpon clicking any tiles with the score, the condition is met and a message box pops up telling us \u0026ldquo;You have accessed the hidden locker, can you unlock it?\u0026rdquo;. How fun, we have unlocked a secret stage to this game.\nClearly, this is also hinting to us that we are closer to the flag now.\nHidden Locker (Secret Stage?!) in the binary   Now, the GUI of the .NET binary has changed. This is no longer a tic tac toe game but we have a PIN pad.\nThe code does something along the lines of:\n Checking the length of the PIN to be 9 Calling method 12, which checks our PIN  private void buttonX_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) { if (!this.bool_0) { if (this.list_0.Contains(\u0026#39;1\u0026#39;)) { this.button1.ForeColor = Color.Lime; this.button1.Text = \u0026#34;O\u0026#34;; this.list_0.Remove(\u0026#39;1\u0026#39;); this.method_8(); } } else { this.method_10(\u0026#39;1\u0026#39;); this.method_11(); } } public void method_11() { if (this.string_0.Length == 9) { this.method_12(); } }   From here, we see that it uses the PIN along with strings in the method Y0uSh0uldPr3ssth, 3butt0ns and TtH/04xZb79By/VnbPZlBgO/D96vRmqPk0QT50gbdi8= for AesCrypto. Now this is the crypto part of the reversing challenge.\nBut firstly, we have to ensure we pass the lengthy if condition for our PIN to even trigger the decryption routine. As it would be used for decryption, there is no point patching this binary to skip the statement as it would not give us the flag even if we manipulated the if condition.\nif (num % num9 == 0 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; num9 * 3 == num2 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; num2 * 3 == num4 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; num5 % num2 == 2 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; num6 * 4 == num5 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; num2 % num4 == num3 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; num2 - num6 == num \u0026amp;\u0026amp; num7 % num3 == num \u0026amp;\u0026amp; num7 / 2 == num6 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; num8 % num2 == num9 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; num8 % num7 == num2) Since this is something very painful (and perhaps impossible to do within the CTF 12 hours) to be done manually, I have decided to use some python scripting help along with z3 black magic.\nTo install, we can simply use pip.\npip install z3-solver Z3 is basically a theorem prover from Microsoft Research, this would help us to solve the equations given the amount of constraints imposed by the game. Please pardon me for my amateur z3 code, I am still learning it.\nfrom z3 import * s = Solver() pin_code = IntVector(\u0026#34;x\u0026#34;, 9) # Add constraints to z3 s.add(pin_code[0] % pin_code[8] == 0) s.add(pin_code[8] * 3 == pin_code[1]) s.add(pin_code[1] * 3 == pin_code[3]) s.add(pin_code[4] % pin_code[1] == 2) s.add(pin_code[5] * 4 == pin_code[4]) s.add(pin_code[1] % pin_code[3] == pin_code[2]) s.add(pin_code[1] - pin_code[5] == pin_code[0]) s.add(pin_code[6] % pin_code[2] == pin_code[0]) s.add(pin_code[6] / 2 == pin_code[5]) s.add(pin_code[7] % pin_code[1] == pin_code[8]) s.add(pin_code[7] % pin_code[6] == pin_code[1]) # Solve res = s.check() if res == sat: print(s.model()) else: print(\u0026#34;Response: %s\u0026#34; % res) Running the z3 solver would provide us the PIN, after doing some rearrangement:\nx__3 = 9 x__4 = 8 x__1 = 3 x__8 = 1 x__5 = 2 x__6 = 4 x__0 = 1 x__7 = 7 x__2 = 3 PIN = 133982471   Finally, with the PIN cracked, we can just enter it in the game using the GUI and a message box will appear giving us the flag!\nYou have obtained the flag!

This post will also discuss some real world scenario and attack surface of the Grafana.\nBrief Analysis on the Root Cause The detailed analysis can be found at the author\u0026rsquo;s blog here, I will only briefly cover it.\nAll API routes were defined in pkg/api/api.go , some require authentication like below:\nr.Get(\u0026#34;/plugins\u0026#34;, reqSignedIn, hs.Index) r.Get(\u0026#34;/plugins/:id/\u0026#34;, reqSignedIn, hs.Index) r.Get(\u0026#34;/plugins/:id/edit\u0026#34;, reqSignedIn, hs.Index) // deprecated \tr.Get(\u0026#34;/plugins/:id/page/:page\u0026#34;, reqSignedIn, hs.Index) While some does not require signed in, like below:\n// expose plugin file system assets \tr.Get(\u0026#34;/public/plugins/:pluginId/*\u0026#34;, hs.getPluginAssets) For the route at /public/plugins/:pluginId/*, it is handled by hs.getPluginAssets, which is defined in pkg/api/plugins.go:\n// getPluginAssets returns public plugin assets (images, JS, etc.) // // /public/plugins/:pluginId/* func (hs *HTTPServer) getPluginAssets(c *models.ReqContext) { pluginID := web.Params(c.Req)[\u0026#34;:pluginId\u0026#34;] plugin, exists := hs.pluginStore.Plugin(c.Req.Context(), pluginID) if !exists { c.JsonApiErr(404, \u0026#34;Plugin not found\u0026#34;, nil) return } requestedFile := filepath.Clean(web.Params(c.Req)[\u0026#34;*\u0026#34;]) pluginFilePath := filepath.Join(plugin.PluginDir, requestedFile) if !plugin.IncludedInSignature(requestedFile) { hs.log.Warn(\u0026#34;Access to requested plugin file will be forbidden in upcoming Grafana versions as the file \u0026#34;+ \u0026#34;is not included in the plugin signature\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;file\u0026#34;, requestedFile) } // It\u0026#39;s safe to ignore gosec warning G304 since we already clean the requested file path and subsequently \t// use this with a prefix of the plugin\u0026#39;s directory, which is set during plugin loading \t// nolint:gosec \tf, err := os.Open(pluginFilePath) the rest are Omitted Line 5 is retrieving /public/plugins/(.*) as the pluginId, then pass to line 12 filepath.Clean to do sanitization, and concatenate in line 13, finally passed to os.Open in line 23 to read the contents.\nThe most interesting part is the comment at line 20:\n // It\u0026rsquo;s safe to ignore gosec warning G304 since we already clean the requested file path and subsequently\n If we check the document on the usage of filepath.Clean:\n  Point 4 is worthy to take note.\n replace \u0026ldquo;/..\u0026rdquo; by \u0026ldquo;/\u0026rdquo; at the beginning of a path\n What if the path does not start with /..? we can try it out:\n  It seems that filepath.Clean is not working as what the developers expect it to do, which leads to directory traversal and subsequently arbitrary file read.\nIt can be replicated in the docker environment as shown below (take note that the plugin should exist, otherwise you will get Plugin not found error. Luckily, Grafana has come with some default plugins. In the screenshot below, I am using Grafana\u0026rsquo;s welcome plugin):\n  Nginx Reverse Proxy Bypass On the day this vulnerability is getting hot amongst the security researchers (around 7th Dec, 2021), the vulnerability author posted a tweet as below:\n  But one day later, he retweeted:\n  So does Nginx help? we can set up the environment and try:\n  We are getting a 400 bad request.\nThe reason is simple: Nginx will do path normalization before it forwards the request to the backend. If the normalized URI is requesting beyond the web root directory, it will simply returns 400 bad request.\nIn the request above, /public/plugins/welcome/../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd will be normalized into /../../../../../../../etc/passwd, hence, a 400 bad request is returned.\nBut does that mean Nginx will protect Grafana against this kind of path traversal attack? May not be. It depends on how you configure the proxy_pass entry. Before I cover that, here is an example:\n  We can see that our path traversal still succeed and read the content of the sdk.ts, which is located two directories above the welcome plugin directory.\nSo here is first point, which is covered in the Nginx document\n If proxy_pass is specified without a URI, the request URI is passed to the server in the same form as sent by a client when the original request is processed\n Scroll back and examine my Nginx configuration, noticed that my proxy_pass entry is defined as http://localhost:3000, without a URI, hence, the original request will be forwarded to the Grafana backend. And in the first place, since my original URI is /public/plugins/welcome/../../sdk.ts, even after normalization by Nginx, it is /public/sdk.ts, which is a valid URI, hence, Nginx will not complain about it either.\nThis allows us to read arbitrary files up to three directory above the plugin directories. But the default plugin directories is deep at /usr/share/grafana/public/app/plugins/{plugin_id}, even being able to traverse up by 3 directories, there aren\u0026rsquo;t many files to read.\nSo here is the second point, which is covered in this post\n URL consists of scheme:[//authority]path[?query][#fragment], and browsers don’t send #fragment. But how must a reverse proxy handle #fragment?\nNginx throws fragment off\n So what would happen if my URI is /public/plugins/welcome/#/../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd?\nNginx will process until /public/plugins/welcome/, and forward the entire URI to the Grafana backend, and leads to path traversal all the way up to the root directory:\n  Attack Surface under Grafana In this section, we try to examine the possible attack surface under Grafana when we are able to read files on the file system.\nGrafana Database We can try to read the database file, which is located at /var/lib/grafana/grafana.db by default, which is a sqlite database:\n  So, what is inside the Grafana database?\nuser table:   The password is hard to decrypt, using a slow hash algorithm with salt as defined in pkg/util/encoding.go:\n// EncodePassword encodes a password using PBKDF2. func EncodePassword(password string, salt string) (string, error) { newPasswd := pbkdf2.Key([]byte(password), []byte(salt), 10000, 50, sha256.New) return hex.EncodeToString(newPasswd), nil } user_auth_token: It seems that user_auth_token is also stored as one-way hash, as defined in /pkg/services/auth/auth_token.go:\nfunc hashToken(token string) string { hashBytes := sha256.Sum256([]byte(token + setting.SecretKey)) return hex.EncodeToString(hashBytes[:]) } I can\u0026rsquo;t think of a way to exploit this, if possible, please tell me =)\ndata_source:   The data_source tells Grafana where to pull the data from.\nFinally there is something that we can exploit. In /pkg/cmd/grafana-cli/commands/datamigrations/encrypt_datasource_passwords_test.go:\nfunc DecryptSecureJsonData(ds *models.DataSource) (map[string]string, error) { decrypted := make(map[string]string) for key, data := range ds.SecureJsonData { decryptedData, err := util.Decrypt(data, setting.SecretKey) if err != nil { return nil, err } decrypted[key] = string(decryptedData) } return decrypted, nil } util.Decrypt is defined in /pkg/util/encryption.go, you can re-use it to decrypt the encrypted password in the data source, or you can use the script here:\n  The secretkey is defined in the Grafana\u0026rsquo;s configuration file, which is located at /etc/grafana/grafana.ini, and it might contains other sensitive information as well. We will cover those next\nGrafana Configuration File Located at /etc/grafana/grafana.ini by default, which might contain several sensitive information. You can take a look at the default configuration file here and see what can be stored inside. I won\u0026rsquo;t go through them one by one.\ngrafana-image-renderer Apart from the various credentials that could be leaked from the Grafana\u0026rsquo;s configuration file, another worth-mentioning entry is the grafana-image-renderer\n[rendering] # Options to configure a remote HTTP image rendering service, e.g. using https://github.com/grafana/grafana-image-renderer. # URL to a remote HTTP image renderer service, e.g. http://localhost:8081/render, will enable Grafana to render panels and dashboards to PNG-images using HTTP requests to an external service. server_url = # If the remote HTTP image renderer service runs on a different server than the Grafana server you may have to configure this to a URL where Grafana is reachable, e.g. http://grafana.domain/. callback_url = # Concurrent render request limit affects when the /render HTTP endpoint is used. Rendering many images at the same time can overload the server, # which this setting can help protect against by only allowing a certain amount of concurrent requests. concurrent_render_request_limit = 30 grafana-image-renderer is a remote HTTP image rendering service, which you can ask the renderer to visit the Grafana panel, render into image and send to us.\nThe official guideline is to set up the grafana-image-renderer service inside a separate docker, and link it to the Grafana docker using Docker Compose like below:\nversion: '2' services: grafana: image: grafana/grafana:latest ports: - '3000:3000' environment: GF_RENDERING_SERVER_URL: http://renderer:8081/render GF_RENDERING_CALLBACK_URL: http://grafana:3000/ GF_LOG_FILTERS: rendering:debug renderer: image: grafana/grafana-image-renderer:latest ports: - 8081 Under this configuration, the renderer service is inaccessible from the Internet.\nHowever, there is another option to run it as a standalone Node.js application.\n  It seems that the service is also listening on the localhost, but actually it is accessible via public network interface:\n  Exposing a renderer that attackers can specify any host for it to visit is not that dangerous unless you are running an outdated renderer:\n  And without sandbox:\n  So RCE is achievable:\n  Reference https://grafana.com/blog/2021/12/08/an-update-on-0day-cve-2021-43798-grafana-directory-traversal/\nhttps://j0vsec.com/post/cve-2021-43798/\nhttps://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/dqJ3F_fStlj78S0qhQ3Ggw\nhttps://pkg.go.dev/path/filepath\nhttps://www.acunetix.com/blog/articles/a-fresh-look-on-reverse-proxy-related-attacks/\nhttps://articles.zsxq.com/id_jb6bwow4zf5p.html\nhttps://articles.zsxq.com/id_baeb9hmiroq5.html\nhttps://github.com/jas502n/Grafana-CVE-2021-43798\nhttps://securitylab.github.com/research/in_the_wild_chrome_cve_2021_30632/\n","permalink":"https://nusgreyhats.org/posts/writeups/a-not-so-deep-dive-in-to-grafana-cve-2021-43798/","summary":"Overview This post will cover some details behind the recent Grafana vulnerability (CVE-2021-43798), which is a directory traversal bug allowing unauthenticated attackers to read files on the target server filesystem.

It is a windows console application that will validate user input and checks the flag entered. I will go into a bit more details since this is a write up for beginners rather than experienced reverse engineers.\n  Understanding the target The first step to reverse engineering is figuring out how the target binary is constructed. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to waste our time reversing a packer or .NET bytecodes in IDA. So, I used Detect It Easy to check the binary.\n  It\u0026rsquo;s written in C++ which may have some mangled functions and complicated classes. But it is not that bad to reverse engineer in a classic decompiler like IDA or Ghidra.\nDecompile Loading the binary in IDA, I can see most of the logic is actually written in the main method.

It is essentially doing the following:\nfor i in range (34): user_input[i] = user_input[i] ^ key[i%16] Then, the while block following the xor operations:\nv7 = 0i64; v8 = v3 - byte_140004508; while ( byte_140004508[v7] == byte_140004508[v7 + v8] ) { if ( ++v7 \u0026gt;= 34 ) { v9 = \u0026#34;Nice.

It is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to induce a server side application to make a HTTP request to a domain of the attacker\u0026rsquo;s choosing.\nTypically, the attacker will target the server\u0026rsquo;s internal only services.\nWhy SSRF?   SSRF trend   Between 2017 to 2021, SSRF have been in the rise and is a new contender in the OWASP top 10.\nSome possible explainations might be the rise of the cloud and microservices architecture.\nA large amount of information today is hosted on the cloud to improve deployment times, high application uptimes as well as autoscaling with technologies such as kubernetes.\nWith the microservices architecture, big services are split up into multiple smaller microservices where each microservice is used to maintain one function of the larger services. The microservices usually communicate with each other over HTTP or other lightweight protocols.\nThis microservices architecture provides a large surface for the attacker to attempt to exploit SSRF. Any single vulnerable service will allow the attacker to access multiple microservices. With more services communicating with each other, the attacker will have a higher chance of finding a more impactful exploit.\nGeneral Impact The impact of SSRF is generally an attack on the server itself or other internal services that can be accessed from the server.\nHow does SSRF work?   SSRF   Although the attacker is unable to access the internal services directly, the attacker can still reach the other internal services through the vulnerable web servers.\nIn the diagram above, the attacker sends a malicious packet to the server to induce the server to make a request to other internal services (Either 1 or 2).\nThis usually occurs due to the lack of sanitization of user input especially when it comes to URLs. For example, if there is a web service that allows other users to convert a webpage into a PDF, the attacker can send the ip address of an internal service to view what is available on the other internal services.\nAn example of such a scenerio is CVE-2020-7740 which affects all versions of node-pdf-generator.\nIn this case, there is no sanitization of the user\u0026rsquo;s url before generating the PDF.\nfunction acceptHtmlAndProvidePdf(request, response) { console.log(\u0026#39;Request received: \u0026#39; + request); request.content = \u0026#39;\u0026#39;; request.addListener(\u0026#34;data\u0026#34;, function (chunk) { if (chunk) { request.content += chunk; } // Lack of checks here  }); request.addListener(\u0026#34;end\u0026#34;, function () { var options = { encoding: \u0026#39;utf-8\u0026#39;, pageSize: request.headers[\u0026#39;x-page-size\u0026#39;] || \u0026#39;Letter\u0026#39; }; response.writeHead(200, { \u0026#39;Content-Type\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;application/pdf\u0026#39; }); htmlToPdf(request.content, options) .pipe(response); console.log(\u0026#39;Processed HTML to PDF: \u0026#39; + response); }); } This allows the attacker to forge a server request as the script fetches the information from the webpage to convert to PDF.\nWhat is the impact of SSRF The impact of SSRF can widely vary depending on different circumstances.\n Denial of Service Remote Code execution Bypassing access control Port Scanning: Reqeusts can be made to different ports and the resulting status code or result shown on the frontend allows the attacker to infer if the port is open Other internal services (Details on the attacks are given in the references below)  Redis: If Redis uses a text based protocol (RESP), the attacker can send a payload with the correct format and send commands to the redis server. Cloud metadata: Metadata API base url can be given to the vulnerable server to retrieve information about the server.    Types of SSRF There are mainly 3 different types of SSRF vulnerabilities.\n Basic SSRF: The result is returned to the frontend and can be seen by the user. Blind SSRF: The result of the attack is not returned to the frontend. Semi-Blind SSRF: The attacker only knows if the payload was successful or not. No details are given.  Comparison between Different Types of SSRF    Criteria Basic SSRF Blind SSRF Semi-Blind SSRF     Can the attacker directly view the page Yes No No   Difficulty of exploitation (In general) Lower Higher Medium    Example of a Basic SSRF An example of a basic SSRF exploit can be found here\nIn this example, the exposed service is running a PDF generation service. It takes in a URL from the user without sanitization and generates a PDF based on the link that it receives.\nWithin the same local environment, there is also another service that is running on localhost:5001 that contains a web server that is only accessible internally.\nBy passing the url of this internal service into the PDF generation service, the attacker can generate a PDF of the webpage that is hosted on the internal service.\nExample of a Blind SSRF An example of a blind SSRF exploit can be found here\nIn this example, the exposed service is a reporting server where users report suspicious attacks to the administrator.\nThe server automatically goes to the website and take a screenshot of the website before generating a markdown file for the admin to view.\nWhich this may seem like a good idea, a request from the server is forged in the process of taking the screenshot.\nAlthough this is harder to exploit compared to the basic SSRF, it can still lead to remote code execution under correct circumstances.\nMitigations for SSRF  Input validation (Sanitization) for URLs given by the user.  This can be in the form of a whitelist or a blacklist (There is a different list of caveats for blacklists) Verification that IP / Domain is not an internal IP address / invalid address.   Do not accept complete URLs from users. Firewall filters to prevent access of unauthorised domains  Bypasses for Mitigations However, for each the mitigations, there might be some bypasses which can be used to reduce the effectiveness of the mitigations.\n Usage of malformed URLs  {domain}@127.0.0.1 or 127.0.1 all redirects to localhost. There are multiple encodings of this url. Similar methods can be used for other urls.   DNS rebinding  The attacker can register a domain and point it to a non-blacklisted website. After the server checks that the domain is valid, the attacker can change it to point to an internal ip address. When the server visits the domain again, the server will visit the internal ip address. More information can be found below   Open Redirect  If there is another open redirection on the page, the open redirection can be used to bypass restrictions on the webpage.   Bypass via Redirection  There might be filtering when it comes to a URL. This can be used to bypass url filters by registering a valid url which bypasses the various types of filtering.   SSRF via Referrer header  Sometimes web applications make use of server side analytics software that tracks visitors. These software logs the referrer header in the request and actually visit the websites to analyze the contents of referrer sites.

So, I need a debugger.\nI am quite familiar with GDB, and there are nice extensions like GEF out there. However, Apple made it so difficult to compile a usable GDB on macOS\u0026hellip; 😑 We are pretty much forced to use LLDB (which I really don\u0026rsquo;t like).\nAnyways, beggars can\u0026rsquo;t be choosers, and vanilla GDB/LLDB is not really usable in the long run, so being able to use the scripting interface is very important. Similar to GDB, LLDB also has a Python scripting interface. Instead of .gdbinit, LLDB loads commands from .lldbinit during startup. There is a great lldbinit project that contains many custom commands which makes LLDB so much nicer to use, and I have a fork of it.\n(It is such a pain to even set breakpoints, vanilla LLDB is just not usable imo.)\nLLDB Architecture and Python Bindings Having the lldbinit extension is good. Being able to add my own custom commands is even better. To do so, I had to understand the architecture of the scripting interface.\nThe LLDB scripting interface is quite tidy. Everything is grouped into modules. Quoting the docs, here are less than half of the modules:\n SBAddress  A section + offset based address class.   SBBreakpoint  Represents a logical breakpoint and its associated settings.   SBBreakpointList  Proxy of C++ lldb::SBBreakpointList class   SBBreakpointLocation  Represents one unique instance (by address) of a logical breakpoint.   SBCommandInterpreter  SBCommandInterpreter handles/interprets commands for lldb.   SBCommandReturnObject  Represents a container which holds the result from command execution.    Feels like writing C++ but in Python. And the basic architecture is as follows:\nLLDB design: ------------| lldb -\u0026gt; debugger -\u0026gt; target -\u0026gt; process -\u0026gt; thread -\u0026gt; frame(s) -\u0026gt; thread -\u0026gt; frame(s)  LLDB talks to the debugger object debugger holds a target target holds a process process holds multiple threads and lastly, each thread has one or more frames  With more details (quoting the docs):\n SBTarget: Represents the target program running under the debugger.  Gives information about the executable, process, modules, memory, breakpoints, etc There\u0026rsquo;s a lot, check the docs   SBProcess: Represents the process associated with the target program.  Gives information about the process, memory Some overlap with the above, but this one doesn\u0026rsquo;t have modules nor breakpoints Check the docs   SBThread: Represents a thread of execution.  Gives information about a thread, e.g. thread ID Exposes functions for stepping (step in, step over, etc) and suspending/resuming Contains stack frame(s) (according to docs, it is possible to have more than 1, but I always see just 1) Check out the docs   SBFrame: Represents one of the stack frames associated with a thread.  Gives information about a stack frame, e.g. registers, functions, symbols, disassembly, etc This is a really useful module because of the information it gives. Check out the docs    Now, some useful functions to access the objects mentioned above (defined by lldbinit):\n SBTarget - get_target() SBProcess - get_process() SBThread - get_thread() SBFrame - get_frame()  Yea, quite easy.\nCreate Custom Commands To define a new command, it is as simple as creating a function in lldbinit.py. For example, to create a command called newcmd:\ndef cmd_newcmd(debugger, command, result, _dict): args = command.split(\u0026#39; \u0026#39;) if len(args) \u0026lt; 1: print(\u0026#39;newcmd \u0026lt;expression\u0026gt;\u0026#39;) return ... Then, the function must be registered as a command in the __lldb_init_module method:\ndef __lldb_init_module(debugger, internal_dict): ... ci.HandleCommand(\u0026#34;command script add -f lldbinit.cmd_newcmd newcmd\u0026#34;, res) ... The function name can be anything, but by convention all command functions in lldbinit go by cmd_\u0026lt;command name\u0026gt;.\nThe function arguments result and _dict might be useful but I don\u0026rsquo;t use them. debugger is the LLDB debugger object mentioned earlier, and command is the exact command string entered by the user.\nWe can use the API listed above to obtain information about the target/process/thread/frame, or perform actions such as setting breakpoints, stepping through instructions, etc.\nExample 1: Reading Memory Here\u0026rsquo;s a simple command I wrote to print unicode strings from memory (similar to x/s but printing unicode strings).\ndef cmd_xu(debugger, command, result, _dict): args = command.split(\u0026#39; \u0026#39;) if len(args) \u0026lt; 1: print(\u0026#39;xu \u0026lt;expression\u0026gt;\u0026#39;) return addr = int(get_frame().EvaluateExpression(args[0]).GetValue(), 10) error = lldb.SBError() ended = False s = u\u0026#39;\u0026#39; offset = 0 while not ended: mem = get_target().GetProcess().ReadMemory(addr + offset, 100, error) for i in range(0, 100, 2): wc = mem[i+1] \u0026lt;\u0026lt; 8 | mem[i] s += chr(wc) if wc == 0: ended = True break offset += 100 print(s) Example 2: Alias It is also possible to make aliases for long commands. For example, an alias for disabling breakpoints, through the SBCommandInterpreter object obtained via the debugger.GetCommandInterpreter() method.\n# disable breakpoint number def cmd_bpd(debugger, command, result, dict): res = lldb.SBCommandReturnObject() debugger.GetCommandInterpreter().HandleCommand(\u0026#34;breakpoint disable \u0026#34; + command, res) print(res.GetOutput()) Example 3: Function Tracing Lastly, here is an example of a more complicated command I wrote to get the list of functions called by the target. This is useful when I am attaching LLDB to Safari, and want to know the functions in a library that were called by Safari when loading a webpage.\nFor example, to see the functions in CoreGraphics called when browsing Wikipedia:\n(lldbinit) cz CoreGraphics [+] Creating breakpoints for all symbols in CoreGraphics [+] Done creating breakpoints for all symbols in CoreGraphics 0x7fff2505d324: | CoreGraphics CGColorSpaceUsesExtendedRange |__ WebKit WebKit::ShareableBitmap::calculateBytesPerRow(WebCore::IntSize, WebKit::ShareableBitmap::Configuration const\u0026amp;) 0x7fff2504a997: | CoreGraphics CGColorSpaceGetNumberOfComponents |__ QuartzCore CABackingStorePrepareUpdates_(CABackingStore*, unsigned long, unsigned long, unsigned int, unsigned int, unsigned int, unsigned long long, CA::GenericContext*, UpdateState*) 0x7fff250496fc: | CoreGraphics CGColorSpaceRetain |__ QuartzCore CA::CG::IOSurfaceDrawable::IOSurfaceDrawable(__IOSurface*, unsigned int, unsigned int, CGColorSpace*, int, int, unsigned int, unsigned int) 0x7fff2549cd24: | CoreGraphics CFRetain |__ CoreGraphics CGColorSpaceRetain 0x7fff2504971c: | CoreGraphics cs_retain_count |__ CoreFoundation _CFRetain 0x7fff2504e3d8: | CoreGraphics CGColorSpaceRelease |__ QuartzCore CABackingStorePrepareUpdates_(CABackingStore*, unsigned long, unsigned long, unsigned int, unsigned int, unsigned int, unsigned long long, CA::GenericContext*, UpdateState*) 0x7fff2505fdd1: | CoreGraphics CGSNewEmptyRegion |__ QuartzCore CABackingStorePrepareUpdates_(CABackingStore*, unsigned long, unsigned long, unsigned int, unsigned int, unsigned int, unsigned long long, CA::GenericContext*, UpdateState*) ... def cmd_cz(debugger, command, result, _dict): args = command.split(\u0026#39; \u0026#39;) if len(args) \u0026lt; 1: print(\u0026#39;cov \u0026lt;module name\u0026gt;\u0026#39;) return module_name = args[0] target = debugger.GetSelectedTarget() module = find_module_by_name(get_target(), module_name) # to keep track of the breakpoints set bpmap = {} print(\u0026#34;[+] Creating breakpoints for all symbols in\u0026#34;, module_name) for symbol in module: sym_name = symbol.GetName() if sym_name.startswith(\u0026#34;os\u0026#34;) or \u0026#34;pthread\u0026#34; in sym_name or \u0026#34;lock\u0026#34; in sym_name or \u0026#34;operator\u0026#34; in sym_name: continue address = symbol.GetStartAddress().GetLoadAddress(target) bp = target.BreakpointCreateByAddress(address) bpmap[address] = bp print(\u0026#34;[+] Done creating breakpoints for all symbols in\u0026#34;, module_name) visited = [] while True: get_process().Continue() thread = get_thread() rip = int(str(get_frame().reg[\u0026#34;rip\u0026#34;].value), 16) if rip in visited: continue if rip not in bpmap.keys(): print(\u0026#34;[+] Dead\u0026#34;) # crashed or something break # disable breakpoint after reaching it one time bpmap[rip].SetEnabled(False) print(hex(rip) + \u0026#34;:\u0026#34;) for i in range(2): frame = thread.GetFrameAtIndex(i) symbol = frame.GetSymbol() module = frame.GetModule().GetFileSpec().GetFilename() print(\u0026#34;|\u0026#34; + \u0026#34;__\u0026#34; * i, module, symbol.GetName()) In this example, I created a breakpoint using target.BreakpointCreateByAddress(address), by using the SBSymbol methods to get a function\u0026rsquo;s address in the process. I also used the lldbinit helper function find_module_by_name to get a SBModule object given a module name.\nThere were more unmentioned API calls used by this command, read the code to learn more if you are interested.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s all.
