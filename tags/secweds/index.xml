Download Slides
Description Antivirus evasion is crucial in many cybersecurity research and operations. For example, red team exercises are often conducted in a hardened production environment. While open-source tools may help in the enumeration or exploitations of services, they are often detected and flagged by antivirus.
In this talk, we will look into manual and partially automated ways to achieve antivirus evasion.</description>

      <description>Talk 1: 1900Hrs - 1945Hrs Talk Title: Unusual Applications of OpenAI in Cybersecurity
One of the most prominent examples of AI-generated synthetic media’s impact on cybersecurity is in the field of social engineering and information operations. However, AI language models can still pop up in interesting places. Could we use OpenAI to convert assembly to pseudocode while reverse-engineering binaries? How about locating vulnerabilities in code? Let’s dive down the rabbit hole of OpenAI’s API, covering the latest advanced features such as fine-tunes, searches, and classifications.</description>

      <description>Talk 1: 1900HRs - 1945HRs Title: Identifying Bugs in Router Firmware at Scale with Taint Analysis
Description Taint analysis is a very useful technique in reverse engineering and bug hunting. For some common vulnerability classes such as command injection or buffer overflow, it can be tedious for a researcher to find them through manual reverse engineering. In this talk, Daniel will share about a tool that he helped develop during his internship, which uses taint analysis techniques to automate the process of finding such bugs in router firmware.</description>

      <description>Talk 1: 1900Hrs - 1945Hrs Talk Title: Cyber Risk Quantification: Let&amp;rsquo;s talk cyber risk
Cybersecurity have been growing in importance and frequently play a key role in organisations in this day and age. With the recent growth of cyber threats and implementation of new cybersecurity laws, the possibility and consequences of exploited cyber risks have increased exponentially as well. As cybersecurity specialists, how can we translate such costs and the benefits of new security controls into something that can be universally understood across the organisation?</description>
