      <description>Talk Title: Practical Application of Fuzzing &amp;ndash; Finding CVE-2021-3376
Download Slides
Description Yi Tian is a current member of NUS Greyhats, and a former intern of Star Labs. During his internship with Star Labs, he wrote fuzzers and harnesses and found an information disclosure vulnerability in Windows Media Foundation, CVE-2021-33760. Fuzzing is often misunderstood and through this presentation, we hope to enlighten you on just what goes into building a harness and running a fuzzer.</description>

      <description>Talk Title: Hacking IoT devices: A story of stealing fingerprints
Description IoT devices are often resource-constrained, so we may forego certain security features because they aren&amp;rsquo;t essential to the use-case. But what if the authentication mechanisms in these devices are used in other, more critical scenarios as well? Discover how smart devices can be turned into wireless biometric thieves in this talk which explores a combination of cryptography, hardware hacking and reverse engineering.</description>

      <description>Talk Title: ARM Confidential Compute Architecture (ARM CCA)
Description ARM CCA represents the latest effort of ARM in pursuing general confidential computing. While ARM has provided a Formal Security Verification (FSV) simulation platform to help develop and test applications on ARMv9 platform, there lacks a Quick Emulator (QEMU) based simulation platform for better debugging. Upon this request, we developed a QEMU-based CCA simulation platform to more easily identify design faults in Realm applications.</description>

Description In this workshop, we will look at some commonly seen patterns in decompiler-generated C pseudocode. By being familiar with these patterns, we can very quickly predict what a piece of code does when we see something similar the next time.
Setup: Please download Ghidra (needs Java to run). If you wish to use other decompilers (e.g. IDA), feel free to do so. However, there might be slight differences in the decompiler output.</description>

      <description>Talk 1: 1900HRs - 1945HRs Title: Defending Singapore’s Digital Borders

At the same time, cyber threats continue to proliferate.
